## Godot Developers forum

The community asked for it, and the community made it! The new [Godot Developers forum](http://godotdevelopers.org) is live and ready for you to use it!

Godot used to have an official forum alongside the [other community channels]({{% ref "community" %}}), but when designing [our new website]({{% ref "article/home-sweet-home" %}}), it was decided to publish it even though we did not have the time and infrastructure to setup a new forum (and most importantly to migrate the old posts into the new database).

Still, many members of the community [expressed their wish](/qa/560/anybody-interested-in-an-unofficial-godot-forum) for a traditional forum to use for general discussion about Godot, advanced support requests and to showcase projects. Some community members thus decided to setup a forum themselves, on their own hosting and using [SMF](http://www.simplemachines.org). With the blessing of the core Godot developers, they did an impressive work to migrate the old database and design cool features and branding for their forum.

A heartfelt thank to Timo (toger5) and Kiori for their dedication, and we hope that you will all have a good experience on this new community forum. Make sure to [read the various announcements](http://godotdevelopers.org/index.php?board=2.0) about the forum rules and how to use its specific features!

## YouTube channel and games showcase

To celebrate this new forum and the recent 2.0 release, we also published a [video showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJFMyI3eZ0) of some of the nice games being developed with Godot. Thanks a lot to Andrew Conrad and Freeman for [editing the video](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/3877) and composing the soundtrack respectively.

We also have an [official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKIDvfZD1ZhY4_hhbotf7wA) to post such videos; we hope to do some more of these showcase videos in the future, and also trailers to show the features of new Godot releases.
