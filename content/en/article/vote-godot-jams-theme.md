As announced [a few days ago]({{% ref "article/upcoming-godot-jam-15-18-june-theme-proposals" %}}), we will have a [Godot Community Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/godotjam062018) the coming week-end, from **Friday 15 June** at 18:00 UTC to **Monday 18 June** at 23:59 UTC. Check the [itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/godotjam062018) page for the latest details and to register!

We had dozens of great proposals for the jam's theme, and made a selection from those for you to vote on. The aim is now to select *one* theme, and everyone can vote for only one entry. Head over to the [Framaforms](https://framaforms.org/theme-for-godot-jam-june-2018-1528803026) poll and pick your favourite theme :)

We're quite hyped to see what the community will cook up during this jam! And stay tuned, we should even have some neat prizes this time :)
