<p>
	After last year's big success, we organize another GodotCon right after FOSDEM, and still in Brussels so that
	you can attend both events at once. GodotCon is the yearly meetup of the Godot&nbsp;Engine community, open to
	all interested users and contributions, whether complete beginners/new users or core developers.
</p>

<p>
	The entrance is free, and we will have various talks and workshops prepared by contributors and users of the
	engine, as well as different related activities.
	The main point is to all meet together with our laptops and hack at some Godot games or the engine itself,
	while getting to know the community in person and learn from experienced users.
</p>

<p>
	Our lead developer Juan Linietsky will come from Argentina for the event, so it's a great opportunity for
	Godot users in Europe to meet him!
</p>

	To spread the word about the event, you can use the
