<p>
	Like the past few years years, we're taking the opportunity that many community members flock to Brussels for
	<a href="#fosdem">FOSDEM 2020</a> to organize our own <em>Godot Conference</em> right after it. There will be
	talks and workshops given by engine users and developers, and plenty of time to discuss with each other and
	play Godot-made games.
</p>

<p>
	A Call for Proposals <a href="/article/meet-community-fosdem-and-godotcon-2020">has been posted</a>, and
	speakers will be announced in January.
</p>

<p>
	This is an event for you (and us) to meet together and get to strengthen the existing bonds between Godot
	contributors and users. Everyone is welcome to join, and the entrance will be free. Even if you aren't
	familiar with Godot&nbsp;Engine yet, this can be a nice opportunity to discover a great game engine and an
	even greater community!
</p>

	To spread the word about the event, you can use the
