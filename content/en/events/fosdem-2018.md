<p>
	<a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> stands for Free and Open Source Developers' European Meeting and is
	held every year in February at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in Brussels, Belgium.
	It is arguably the biggest European event about free and open source software, with free entry and thousands
	of developers and users of various projects attending.
</p>

<h4>Godot stand (with goodies!)</h4>

<p>
	Like last year, we will have a <a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/stands/">Godot&nbsp;Engine stand</a>. It will
	be located in Building K (<a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/buildings/#k">Campus plan</a>,
	<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=50.81474&mlon=4.38164#map=17/50.81474/4.38164">OpenStreetMap</a>).
	We invite all Godot users and contributors from Europe and beyond to join us there and help us man the stand,
	distribute goodies and talk to the other visitors about our engine.
</p>

<h4>Meeting the community</h4>

<p>
	The primary purpose for many of us will be to meet each other in person after having worked for months or
	even years together online. We will have plenty of time to grab some Belgian beers together, and maybe
	organize a community dinner together on Saturday evening.
</p>

<p>
	Our lead dev Juan Linietsky (from Buenos Aires) will also be present, so don't miss this opportunity to meet
	him in Europe :)
