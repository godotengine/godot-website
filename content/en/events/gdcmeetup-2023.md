<p>
	Feels good to be back! To continue with our tradition, thanks to our friends over at GitHub we are
	holding the third annual Godot GDC Meetup.
</p>

<p>GitHub is generously hosting us again at their headquarters.</p>

<p>
	The event is open to anyone interested in Godot Engine: AAA, indie, and hobbyist developers of all
	levels are welcome. Snacks, drinks, talks, and Godot!
</p>
