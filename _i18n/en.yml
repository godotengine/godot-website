    design:
      title: Intuitive scene-driven design
      cards:
        build_game:
          title: Build your game from simple blocks
          text: Use building blocks called nodes to create more complex and reusable scenes. Add scripts to your scenes and customize built-in behavior to implement your unique game mechanics. Rely on composition and node hierarchy to make game logic clear at a glance.
        extend_features:
          title: Extend beyond features provided by the engine
          text: Make your scenes into full-featured components, with tools for your designers to tweak and adjust the look and function. Share your components with the community of like-minded developers as addons and templates.
        data_driven:
          title: Create data-driven elements with custom resources
          text: Define scriptable objects called resources to describe characters, entities, and data structures in your game. Use your custom objects directly in the editor by assigning them to nodes. Resources come with a high-level API to store and read them, and they support every Godot type, including other resources.
    script:
      title: Coding tools that fit your needs
      cards:
        gdscript:
          title: Write code without hurdles with a high-level scripting language
          text: Get things done quickly with Godot's built-in scripting language GDScript. Inspired by Python and other languages, it is easy to pick up even if you are a beginner. Tight engine integration allows it to express game logic in a clear and natural form.
          extra: GDScript offers optional static typing support, boosting your coding efficiency and runtime performance. Powerful language features and first-class functions allow for expressive yet concise code.
        csharp:
          title: Leverage your C# experience to feel right at home
          text: If you're an experienced C# user, Godot offers you first-class support for the .NET platform. Power your games with familiar libraries and give them a performance boost, while still benefiting from close engine integration.
          extra: "<strong>Note:</strong> .NET support is provided as a dedicated engine executable. <a href='https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/index.html#c-platform-support'>C# support is available for desktop and mobile platforms as of Godot 4.2.</a> Web support should be added in the future, but until then, <a href='/download/3.x/'>Godot 3</a> remains a supported option."
        gdextension:
          title: Pick from a variety of community-supported languages
          text: Godot is built to be extended, and that means you can choose a programming language not provided by the Godot team itself. Thanks to our community there are many language bindings for popular tools like Rust, Nim, Python, and JavaScript.
          extra: C++ supports comes officially in the form of GDExtension API, which gives you a way to script and program your game components for maximum performance without having to recompile the engine.
        modules:
          title: Modify the engine itself and integrate with 3rd party libraries
          text: Thanks to the modular structure and a straightforward build process of Godot, you can create your own engine modules. Gain every last drop of performance or integrate with many 3rd party libraries with low-level C++ code.
    3d:
      title: Simple yet powerful 3D engine
      cards:

          extra: Import Blender files directly for fast iterations or keep using familiar glTF and FBX formats.
        movie:
          title: Create animated videos and prerendered cutscenes in engine
          text: With the new movie maker mode, you can record gameplay and scripted scenes from your project at a stable framerate and guaranteed simulation speed. Together with Godot's animation capabilities, make the most out of the engine's visuals.
