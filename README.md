# Godot Website

This repository contains the theme and plugins used in Godot Engine's
October instance.

## Development

### Browser support

When working on new features, keep in mind this website only supports
_evergreen browsers_:

- Chrome (latest version and N-1 version)
- Edge (latest version and N-1 version)
- Firefox (latest version, N-1 version, and latest ESR version)
- Opera (latest version and N-1 version)
- Safari (latest version and N-1 version)

Internet Explorer isn't supported.

### Dependencies

- [Docker](https://docker.com)
  - It's also possible to install PHP 7.2+, MySQL and October manually,
    but this isn't covered in this README.

### Running the site

- Clone this repository.
- Put a database dump (if you have one) into the `/docker/mariadb/init` folder.
  - Make sure that your script starts with the line `USE october;` and that the file extension is `.sql`.
- Run the `./docker/restart.sh` script (this will take a while the first time).
- You might need to reinstall some plugins `/docker/php/install-plugin.sh author.name`.
  - Replace `author.name` with the names in the `/plugins/[author]/[name]` folders.
- See the website at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Restoring a database

```sh
mv /your/dump/backup-file.sql docker/mariadb/init
docker/mariadb/bash.sh
cd /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
mysql < 000-setup.sql
mysql < backup-file.sql
```

### Interfacing with the Docker containers

You can use the standard `docker exec -it godotengine-org--[php|mariadb] [command]` syntax or the following scripts:

- `./docker/php/bash.sh`
- `./docker/php/install-plugin.sh`
- `./docker/php/log.sh`
- `./docker/mariadb/bash.sh`
- `./docker/mariadb/log.sh`
- `./docker/mariadb/mysql.sh`

### Setting up the theme

- Log into the October backend (located at `/backend`) and change the frontend theme from the Settings tab.
  - Alternatively, you can edit `config/cms.php` and change the theme to `godotengine` there.
- Change directory into `plugins/paulvonzimmerman/patreon` then run `composer install`.
- You should now have approximately what's in production. The only missing
  pieces are everything that's stored in the production database
  (blog entries).

### Syntax highlighting

If you use Visual Studio Code, you can install the
[OctoberCMS Template Language](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dqsully.octobercms-template-language)
extension to benefit from syntax highlighting in `.htm` templates.
