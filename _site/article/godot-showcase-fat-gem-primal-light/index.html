This week, we are interviewing the studio Fat Gem about their first game <em>Primal Light</em>.<hr><h3 id=introduce-your-studio-in-a-few-sentences>Introduce your studio in a few sentences.</h3><p>Hi, I’m Shane Sicienski. My friend Jeff Nixon and I make games together under the name Fat Gem.<h3 id=introduce-your-project-in-a-few-sentences-description-supported-platforms-release-date-etc>Introduce your project in a few sentences: description, supported platforms, release date, etc.</h3><p>Primal Light is a linear 2D action platformer for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It was released on July 09, 2020 and is available on <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/771420/Primal_Light/>Steam</a>.<p>In the game, you play as Krog, a one-eyed blue caveman wearing a red loincloth, who is on a quest to save his tribe from an evil moon god.<p>The game features 10 challenging levels with arcade-style combat reminiscent of the 16-bit era. As you progress, you acquire new acrobatic abilities which allow you to overcome obstacles and enemies. Each level ends with a gruesome boss.<h3 id=how-did-you-discover-godot-when-did-you-start-using-it-do-you-have-prior-experience-with-other-game-engines>How did you discover Godot? When did you start using it? Do you have prior experience with other game engines?</h3><p>Around 4 years ago, I was learning how to program (in order to do natural language processing) when it suddenly dawned on me that I had probably learned enough to be able to make a game. I prototyped a little top-down Zelda clone and showed it to my friend Jeff one night while we were hanging out at his apartment. We were so excited by the prospect of making a game that he dove headfirst into pixel art and I into programming. That was around August 2017.<p>We started making Primal Light in Python (using the <a href=https://www.pygame.org/news>PyGame</a> module), but when we started getting serious about the project, we decided to shift to a full-fledged engine.<p>I had seen Godot come up in comments on <a href=https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/>Game Development Stack Exchange</a> with people describing it as “Pythonic”, so it seemed like a natural candidate for me.<p>At that time, I didn’t have experience with any engines outside of PyGame, but since then I’ve become proficient in GMS2 and Unity, in addition to Godot.<h3 id=why-did-you-choose-godot-for-your-project>Why did you choose Godot for your project?</h3><p>When we were deliberating on moving to a full-fledged engine, I had seen Godot come up in comments on <a href=https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/>Game Development Stack Exchange</a> with people describing it as “Pythonic”, so it seemed like a natural candidate for me. The fact that I am also a big fan of Samuel Beckett didn’t hurt Godot’s chances with me.<h3 id=which-parts-of-the-game-development-process-did-you-enjoy-the-most-while-working-on-your-project>Which parts of the game development process did you enjoy the most while working on your project?</h3><p>Jeff and I both enjoyed designing bosses and boss battles.<h3 id=which-parts-of-the-game-development-process-did-you-find-the-most-difficult-to-apply-in-your-project>Which parts of the game development process did you find the most difficult to apply in your project?</h3><p>Jeff and I were flying by the seat of our pants on this project, as it is our first game. We encountered difficulties all over the place, but our sheer excitement at making a game sustained us. We found level design intimidating at first, but, like lots of things, it becomes fun once you try to study it and learn its mysterious rules.<h3 id=how-has-godot-helped-you-advance-on-your-project-which-aspects-of-godot-do-you-consider-to-be-its-strength>How has Godot helped you advance on your project? Which aspects of Godot do you consider to be its strength?</h3><p>Godot has a ton of strengths. A few come to mind. First, Godot uses the pixel as the native unit of measurement, which makes it ideal for 2D games. Second, Godot has a much better implementation of coroutines than other engines (and coroutines are a game developer’s best friend). Third, Godot’s signal system provides an out-of-the-box implementation of the observer pattern that is more intuitive that what you have in other engines (for example, using C# events). Finally, Godot has better animation tools than other engines I have worked with.<h3 id=how-do-you-find-godots-multi-platform-support-both-for-the-editor-and-your-final-project>How do you find Godot’s multi-platform support, both for the editor and your final project?</h3><p>We developed Primal Light on both Windows & Mac and had no issues whatsoever, even on old hardware (I started development on a 2008 MacBook). We built for Windows, Mac, & Linux, and found it a breeze, even accommodating Steam integration across all three platforms using the life-saving <a href=https://github.com/Gramps/GodotSteam>GodotSteam</a> repo. Godot’s option to toggle between GLES2 and GLES3 also makes it easy to build for specific rendering architectures if needed.<p>The only issues we encountered were some inconsistent capitalization in our filenames causing crashes on case-sensitive OSes, and using the same variable name in both a local and nested local context causing crashes on Mac (both easily fixed).<h3 id=which-challenges-have-you-encountered-when-using-godot>Which challenges have you encountered when using Godot?</h3><p>We had some thorny issues with pixel jitter when our camera would settle on the player, but I think that’s a cross-engine problem which plagues pixel art games in general.<p>We tried to use Godot’s native Camera2D offset when implementing screenshake, but offset alone wouldn’t allow the viewport to traverse camera limits if the camera was adjacent to them. I filed that as a bug on GitHub and Godot devs fixed it in Godot 3.1 or thereabouts.<p>We originally had Light2Ds littered throughout the game (for example, for candle effects), but it caused severe performance issues. This was a known issue for Light2Ds back then. I think I heard that Godot devs recently made strides in improving their performance, but I’m not certain.<h3 id=which-features-would-you-like-to-see-in-future-versions-of-godot>Which features would you like to see in future versions of Godot?</h3><p>I think Godot has an excellent feature set as is, and I am typically a fan of minimalism. Some of the larger engines have bloat that irritates me aesthetically.<p>I know some people would like to see a sprite editor in the engine (similar to what you have in GMS2), but I never encountered a use case for that in my own development.<p>I recall a Twitter poll recently which asked Godot users what should be focused on in the near future. I voted for improvements to tilemap functionality, which was the frontrunner at least at that time.<h3 id=would-you-use-godot-for-a-future-project>Would you use Godot for a future project?</h3><p>One hundred times yes!<hr><p><em>Primal Light is available on <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/771420/Primal_Light/>Steam</a> for Windows, macOS and Linux.</em></div></div></article></div><link rel=stylesheet href=/assets/css/anchor-link.css?1><link rel=stylesheet href=/assets/css/article-cards.css?2><script src=/assets/js/anchor-link.js></script>
