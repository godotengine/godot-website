  <h3 class="title">The engine</h3>
  <p>
    Godot&nbsp;Engine is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software">free and open source software</a>
    released under the permissive <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/LICENSE.txt">MIT license</a> (also named Expat license).
  </p>
  <p>This license grants users a number of freedoms:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You are free to use Godot&nbsp;Engine, for any purpose</li>
    <li>You can study how Godot&nbsp;Engine works and change it</li>
    <li>You can distribute unmodified and changed versions of Godot&nbsp;Engine, even commercially and under a different license (including proprietary)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The only restriction to that third freedom is that you need to distribute the copyright notice and license statement of Godot&nbsp;Engine whenever you redistribute it.
    So your derivative product may have a different license, but should still state in its documentation that it derives from the MIT licensed Godot&nbsp;Engine (see below).
  </p>

  <h3 class="title">Your game</h3>
  <p>
    Godot&nbsp;Engine's license terms and copyright do not apply to the content you create with it; you are free to license your games how you see best fit,
    and will be their sole copyright owner(s).
  </p>
  <p>
    Note however that the Godot&nbsp;Engine binary that you would distribute with your game is a copy of the "Software" as defined in the license,
    and you are therefore required to include the copyright notice and license statement somewhere in your documentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Godot&nbsp;Engine developers consider that a link to this page (<a href="/license">godotengine.org/license</a>) in your game documentation or credits would be an
    acceptable way to satisfy the license terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    See <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/complying_with_licenses.html">Complying with Licenses</a> in the documentation for more information.
  </p>
