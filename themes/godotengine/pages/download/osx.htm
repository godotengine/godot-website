  <p>
    Godot is currently not code-signed for macOS. See the last section of
    <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">this page</a>
    for instructions on allowing Godot to run anyway. Alternatively, you can install
    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/404790">Godot from Steam</a> to work around this.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also get Godot with <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> or <a href="https://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a>.
    Note that the version available on Homebrew isn't code-signed either.
    Software released through MacPorts does not need to be code-signed to run;
    this means Godot on MacPorts is not affected by Gatekeeper restrictions.
