      <h3>Godot @ GDC 2023</h3>

      <p>We are excited to announce that the Godot Engine will attend the 2023 <a href="https://gdconf.com/">Game Developers Conference</a> (GDC), on March 20-24.</p>

      <p><a href="https://w4games.com/">W4 Games</a> is sponsoring us this year, thanks to them, the Godot Engine will have its own booth for the first time. We got in touch and teamed up with a selection of Godot developers from all over the world to present their high-profile games at our booth, and share their Godot experience with visitors. This is an excellent opportunity if you want to meet the people behind the engine, or other like-minded folks, so come to hang out and play some of the fantastic games.</p>

      <p>You might even get some free swag ;)</p>

      <p>To visit the conference you must purchase a visitor pass. Access to the show floor is available starting with the Expo Pass. Keep in mind that pass <strong>prices increase</strong> over time. Check the <a href="https://gdconf.com/passes-prices">GDC website</a> for more information.</p>
