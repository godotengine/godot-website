<h3 class="title">Patreon</h3>

<p>
  Patreon is a platform for creators to crowdfund their work via monthly donations. Godot&nbsp;Engine launched a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/godotengine">Patreon page</a> with the aim to collect enough money each month to hire some of its developers part-time or full-time, starting with its lead developer Juan Linietsky

<p>
  The Patreon donations are processed by Conservancy, which then uses them to hire developers based on contracts made transparent to all supporters.
