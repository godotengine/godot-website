<p>
  <em>The information on this page only pertains to Godot 4.0 and later. Godot 3.x does not have support for using FBX2glTF directly, but you can use it as a command line tool to convert scenes before placing the converted glTF file in the Godot project folder.</em>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBX">FBX</a> is a popular proprietary
  3D interchange format from Autodesk. It is often used in game engines to allow
  importing 3D scenes created using software such as Blender, Maya or 3DS Max.
</p>
<p>
  Godot does not include an FBX importer in its editor code, as doing so would
  require linking against a proprietary SDK. Relying on reverse engineering was
  <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/fbx-importer-rewritten-for-godot-3-2-4">attempted in the past</a>,
  but it turned out to be too unreliable.
</p>
<p>
  However, thanks to a tool known as FBX2glTF, <strong>it is still possible to import
  FBX scenes to Godot</strong> in a transparent manner. But first…
</p>

<h3 class="title">Consider using glTF 2.0 instead</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlTF">glTF</a> is an open 3D
  interchange format. Unlike FBX, it has many open source implementations
  available and is supported out of the box in Godot.
</p>
<p>
  We recommend using glTF over FBX for several reasons:
  <ul>
    <li>glTF is better supported in open source 3D software such as Blender.</li>
    <li>
      glTF import is integrated in the Godot editor. This way, team members
      working on your project don't need to install external tools before they
      can start working on the project.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you use headless exporting (continuous integration) for your project,
      you don't need to install external tools before you can export the
      project.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you use the Android or HTML5 editor, you can import glTF scenes, but
      not FBX scenes as these platforms don't allow running arbitrary external
      executables.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you use a device on a non-x86 architecture, you can import glTF scenes,
      but not FBX scenes as the Autodesk FBX SDK is only available for x86
      architectures.
    </li>
    <li>
      glTF is an open standard. Unlike FBX, it doesn't force other software to
      link against a proprietary SDK to reliably import 3D scenes.
    </li>
  </ul>

<h3 class="title"">Download FBX2glTF</h3>
<p><strong>
  By downloading FBX2glTF, you accept the
  <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/FBX2glTF/releases/latest/download/FBX-SDK-License.rtf">Autodesk LICENSE AND SERVICES AGREEMENT for Autodesk FBX SDK 2020</a>
  as FBX2glTF includes this proprietary FBX SDK.

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/FBX2glTF">Upstream FBX2glTF</a> is not maintained anymore, so the <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/FBX2glTF">Godot Engine fork of FBX2glTF</a>
  must be used instead.
</p>
<p>
  Here are download links for the latest version of Godot Engine's FBX2glTF fork:

    </a>
  </div>

<p>
  The macOS x86_64 binary can be used with an ARM Godot editor binary. In this
  case, macOS will automatically use Rosetta when running FBX2glTF. Creating an
  universal macOS binary (x86_64 + ARM) for FBX2glTF is planned in the future.
</p>

<p>
  There are no plans to support the Android and HTML5 editor with FBX import, as
  those platforms don't allow executing arbitrary external programs.<br>
  For Android and HTML5, you can use FBX2glTF on another device then save the
  converted glTF file.
