  Let’s make our dream engine together!
</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Godot is the first Free and Open Source game engine in the same league
  as the current big, commercial ones,</strong> with many innovations in
  workflow, features and usability.
</p>
<p>
  It offers a complete editor, dedicated 2D and 3D engines, animation tools,
  multi-platform exports, plugins, a Free asset store, and so much more! All
  that in a lightweight (30 MB) package that runs smoothly on Windows, Mac and
  Linux. <a href="/download">You can start using Godot now!</a>

  time. You can publish your creations for desktop, mobile and web platforms.
</p>
<p>
  The engine's development is open, made hand in hand with the community.

<h3 class="title">Godot needs your support!</h3>
<p>
  Godot is mainly developed by volunteers who have other jobs and occupations.
  To ensure the project can keep growing at a steady pace, we want to offer our
  most proficient contributors the opportunity to work full time for the
  project, doing what they love and benefiting everyone in the process.
</p>
<p>
  In order to do this, we need to ensure them enough financial stability so they
  can work efficiently and without worries.
</p>
<p>
  For this, we need your support!
</p>

<h3 class="title">Let’s hire people who can make the difference</h3>
<p>
  Currently Juan Linietsky and George Marques are working thanks to an
  <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-engine-was-awarded-epic-megagrant">
    Epic MegaGrant</a>, and the project is hiring Rémi Verschelde via Patreon. We want to
  be able to hire more of our contributors so they can work full time, many of
  them who have already proven to do fantastic work via previous grants.
</p>
<p>
  The areas we want to cover (where trustworthy contributors would be willing to
  dedicate their full time) are:
  <ul>
    <li>General editor usability and bug-fixing</li>
    <li>Contributor for networking, HTML5 platform port</li>
    <li>Mono / C#, GDNative</li>
    <li>XR and mobile rendering</li>
    <li>Junior rendering contributor</li>
    <li>
      More areas to come! These can evolve based on development priorities and
      the availability of core contributors to fill those roles.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Let's work together to make all of them a reality!
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>,
  a well-known non-profit and our kind partner, takes care of all donations.
  The organization works hard to preserve the freedom of free software.
  It supports many high-profile projects with everything related to law,
  accounting and taxes.
</p>
<p>
  They use the funds to hire developers according to instructions from the Godot
  Project Leadership Committee. This guarantees that your funds will solely
  benefit the engine, and nothing else.
</p>
<p>

    Note: 10% of our donations go towards supporting Conservancy’s activity
    (this is already included in the pledges).
