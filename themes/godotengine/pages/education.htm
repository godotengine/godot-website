<div class="question">
  <h3>Can I teach Godot in my classroom?</h3>
  <p>Godot&nbsp;Engine is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software">free and open source
      software</a> released under the permissive <a href="/license">MIT license</a>.<br>
    You can use Godot in your classroom without any restrictions and with zero licensing
    costs.

<div class="question">
  <h3>Will the Godot project sign a services agreement provided by my institution?</h3>
  <p>The Godot Engine project is unable to accept any terms and conditions outside of the MIT license, nor will it
    provide warranties or representations about the Godot Engine outside those of the <a
      href="/license">MIT license</a>.</p>
  <p>As a free and open source project, Godot is not backed by a corporation or any individual. Accordingly, it doesn't
    have the legal capacity to enter into agreements, even if such agreements did not conflict with the MIT license.</p>

<div class="question">
  <h3>What data does the Godot Engine collect from users?</h3>
  <p>When you use the Asset Library in the Godot Engine application, HTTPS requests are made to the Asset Library
    website, and will contain: Godot Engine version, search query, selected assets, and the user's IP address. The Asset
    Library
    processes this data without storing it, but our TuxFamily hosting's HTTP server may log these requests. Such logs
    are subject to <a href="https://faq.tuxfamily.org/Privacy/En" target="_blank">TuxFamily's privacy policy</a>.<br>
    This is the only personal data collected by the Godot Engine application.</p>
  <p>To be clear, the Godot Engine executable does not ask for or otherwise collect personally identifying information
    from
    its users. The network requests include the bare minimum amount of information required to do an online search and
    transmit substantially less information than most internet browsing will.</p>
