  <h3>Legal status</h3>
  <p>
    Godot is legally a part of the
    <a href="https://sfconservancy.org">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>. As a
    not-for profit charity, the Software Freedom Conservancy receives donations
    and, based on their mission statement, uses them for the benefit of the
    project.
    <strong>As no company is behind Godot, it can't be sold or purchased.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Within the organization sits the Godot
    <a href="/contact#plc">Project Leadership Comittee</a>. This committee
    decides and authorizes the usage of project funds (donations and grants).
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="/license">Godot's license is MIT</a>. This means you can do pretty
    much everything with it, as long as you don't misrepresent the origin of the
    software. In practice, even with that condition in place, you can do
    anything you want as if you wrote Godot yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    Still, the MIT license allows creating proprietary derivatives.
    Many companies have private forks of the engine to suit their own needs, but
    what is open will remain open forever. <strong>No legal way exists to revoke
    your right to use Godot.</strong> It's as if it was your own property;
    nobody can take it from you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Godot is made by thousands of skilled contributors who donate their free
    time (some of them are paid from donations). Even if some contributors
    suddenly decided to push new Godot versions as proprietary, it would be
    difficult for them to compete or be as productive as the rest. Godot is a
    true community effort, created and owned by everyone.
  </p>

  <h3>Project leadership, fund usage and decisions</h3>
  <p>
    While Godot has a <a href="/contact#plc">Project Leadership Committee</a>,
    <strong>there is no central authority deciding what gets done</strong>.
    The Project Leadership Committee rarely decides something on its own.
    Usage of funds is discussed and approved by the
    <em>advisors</em>, which is a group of about 30 veteran trusted contributors
    and area maintainers. We hold online meetings and discuss these topics
    regularly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Godot is a large project and the advisors have a great reach to all
    areas of the project, both technical and social. Our meetings are generally
    well-informed, which allows steering the project direction more precisely.
  </p>
  <p>
    Contributors cannot request to join the advisors or the Project Leadership
    Committee. Instead, contributors who are deemed trustworthy enough can be
    asked to join the advisors or the Project Leadership Committee.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Paid contributors are paid to do what they already do well</strong>:
    to contribute more time to the areas they already have been contributing.
    This means that if a particular area of development gets funding, this does
    not mean other parts of the engine will get less attention as a result.
