  <h3>Legal status</h3>
  <p>
    On its own, Godot has no legal status. Godot exists as a member project of
    the <a href="https://sfconservancy.org">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>
    (SFC). The SFC provides a home and infrastructure for Free, Libre, and Open
    Source Software (FLOSS) projects by aggregating the work necessary for
    running a non-profit organization including accounting and legal compliance.
    For more information about what the SFC provides, please refer to <a
    href="https://sfconservancy.org/projects/services/">their website</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>As no company is behind Godot, it can't be sold or purchased by another company.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    While the SFC provides the corporate infrastructure to support the Godot
    project, it doesn't make decisions for the project. Instead it provides a
    set of rules for how the member projects operate and provides financial
    oversight to make sure that money is spent in a responsible way that
    advances the project and fits with Conservancy's 501(c)(3) mission to
    promote, advance, and defend software freedom. Each member project has a
    Project Leadership Committee that instructs the SFC on how to spend that
    project's funding.
  </p>

  <h3 id="plc">The Project Leadership Committee</h3>
  <p>
    The Project Leadership Committee (PLC) is responsible for making all funding
    and institutional decisions for the Godot project. The PLC is made of the
    project founders (Ariel Manzur and Juan Linietsky) as well as trusted
    contributors and community members. As spaces open up on the PLC, current
    members may reach out to contributors and community members with a proven
    track record and deep understanding of the project and ask them to join.
  </p>
  <p>
    The PLC must be made of a balance of contributors with technical expertise,
    and community members who bring the perspective of the community at large.
    The PLC is subject to rules set by the Software Freedom Conservancy. For
    more information about the PLC's policies please refer to the
    <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/projects/policies/">Software Freedom
    Conservancy's project policies</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The PLC currently consists of the following members:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ariel Manzur — <i>ariel@godotengine.org</i></li>
    <li>Bastiaan Olij — <i>bastiaan@godotengine.org</i></li>
    <li>Clay John — <i>clay@godotengine.org</i></li>
    <li>George Marques — <i>george@godotengine.org</i></li>
    <li>Hein-Pieter van Braam-Stewart — <i>hp@godotengine.org</i></li>
    <li>Ilaria Cislaghi — <i>ilaria@godotengine.org</i></li>
    <li>Juan Linietsky — <i>juan@godotengine.org</i></li>
    <li>Julian Murgia — <i>julian@godotengine.org</i></li>
    <li>Rémi Verschelde — <i>remi@godotengine.org</i></li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="advisors">Advisors</h3>
  <p>
    The PLC has enlisted the help of its most trusted and veteran contributors
    whom they call <em>the advisors</em>. The advisors are consulted on usage
    of funds as well as institutional matters. It is important to note,
    however, that while the advice of the advisory panel is weighed heavily,
    the final authority on these matters remains with the PLC.  In practice,
    the PLC rarely makes an important decision without at least discussing it
    with the advisors first.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like the PLC, contributors do not apply to become advisors. Instead the
    process of joining the advisors group is organic; trusted contributors may
    be asked to join after showing dedication, expertise, and leadership
    within the Godot community. As a result, the advisors are a diverse group
    of individuals with expertise in all areas of Godot development.
  </p>

  <h3>Funding decisions</h3>
  <p>
    All donations and sponsorships go directly to the SFC. The Godot PLC makes
    all decisions on how the funds are used, following rules established by
    Software Freedom Conservancy. These rules dictate that funding can only be
    used for the benefit of the project. Usage of funds generally includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hiring contributors</li>
    <li>Organizing events</li>
    <li>Reimbursements for travelling to events</li>
    <li>Purchasing hardware required for contributors to work on Godot</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    While the exact costs spent remain private, we do our best to publish how
    much we get and how much we spend. All funding decisions are ultimately
    approved by the Software Freedom Conservancy which has strict (but
    reasonable) <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/projects/policies/conservancy-travel-policy.html"
    >limits on spending, hourly rates, and reimbursements</a>.
    As such, no one hired receives more than industry standard rates.
  </p>

  <h3>Technical decisions</h3>
  <p>
    Technical decisions are made by Area Owners and the project leaders.
    Godot has the following established roles:
  </p>

  <h4>Leadership</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Juan Linietsky — Technical and Project Lead</li>
    <li>Rémi Verschelde — Project Manager</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The project leaders have final say on all code merges. In theory, this means
    the leaders will have the final say when maintainers cannot agree. In
    practice, this authority rarely needs to be invoked because decisions are
    made by maintainers in consultation with the community.
  </p>

  <h4>Teams and area owners</h4>
  <p>
    <a href="/teams">Engine teams</a> are groups of contributors interested in
    a specific area of the engine. Teams provide a way for contributors to have
    focused discussions with other people with similar expertise and interests.
    The opinion and expertise of team members is valued in discussions, but
    ultimately the authority over an area of the engine belongs solely to the
    area owner and the project leadership. Area owners are entrusted with final
    say for code merges in their areas. Area owners are trusted contributors who
    are chosen by the project leadership and have shown knowledge of the specific
    area of the engine and the engine's philosophy as a whole.
  </p>
  <p>
    In practice, area owners aim for consensus among contributors, especially
    among the relevant team. The "rule of thumb" is to not merge code if
    significant disputes exist over a change. However the final decision still
    remains with the area owner. The Godot project strives for rich, public,
    technical discussions where anyone can contribute and agree on the way to
    move forward. Additionally, the leadership and area owners consult with
    other contributors and the community as much as possible every time new
    features and improvements are planned.
  </p>

  <h4>Community</h4>
  <p>
    We strive to make our relationship with the community as symbiotic as
    possible within the limits of feasibility. The Godot community is made up of
    users, contributors, maintainers, and project leadership. Godot exists
    because its community trusts the work we do, so we try to entrust the
    community with deciding the general direction of the project as much and as
    openly as possible. This is how we see the process as community-driven:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Open development:</strong> All development (code that makes it
      into the engine, docs, website, etc) is made via
      <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls">Pull Requests</a>.
      They are open for anyone to see, review and comment on. From the
      leadership to the new contributors, everyone is required to create them in
      order for their work to be included. Pull Requests are approved and merged
      by the respective area maintainers while, again, always striving to
      promote agreement before moving forward. All improvements to the engine
      are made through the Pull Requests of community members.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Open discussion:</strong> Before doing any significant amount of
      work, we encourage maintainers, contributors, and community to open and
      discuss features and proposals in the <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals"
      >Godot proposals repository</a>.
      This allows all contributors to have a much better understanding of how users expect
      the new feature to be used. Because the primary aim of Godot is to produce
      a useful tool, we ask those who open proposals to discuss real-world use
      cases based on problems they are having with their current projects. This
      allows maintainers and contributors to have a much more "down to earth"
      understanding of user's requirements. This philosophy is best explained in
      the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/community/contributing/best_practices_for_engine_contributors.html"
      >engine contributor guidelines</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Community-minded:</strong> The Godot project is developed by and
      for the community. No corporate entity exists behind Godot that
      prioritizes one feature over another. Priorities are set by project
      leadership and area maintainers based on the feedback of the community in
      bug reports, proposals, and discussions in the various community channels.
      Ultimately, it is the community that determines the direction of the
      project.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Every improvement to the engine, whether it is a feature or bug fix, is
    driven forward by Godot's community of contributors, users, maintainers, and
    leadership. Godot wouldn't exist in its current form without the countless
    contributions it receives from community members every day.
