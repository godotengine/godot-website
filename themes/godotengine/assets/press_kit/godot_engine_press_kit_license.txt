The engine

Godot Engine is free and open source software released under the permissive MIT license (also named Expat license).

This license grants users a number of freedoms:

    You are free to use Godot Engine, for any purpose
    You can study how Godot Engine works and change it
    You can distribute unmodified and changed versions of Godot Engine, even commercially and under a different license (including proprietary)

The only restriction to that third freedom is that you need to distribute the
copyright notice and license statement of Godot Engine whenever you redistribute it.
So your derivative product may have a different license,
but should still state in its documentation that it derives from the MIT licensed Godot Engine (see below).

Your game

Godot Engine's license terms and copyright do not apply to the content you create with it;
you are free to license your games how you see best fit, and will be their sole copyright owner(s).

Note however that the Godot Engine binary that you would distribute with your game is a copy of
the "Software" as defined in the license, and you are therefore required to
include the copyright notice and license statement somewhere in your documentation.

The Godot Engine developers consider that a link to this page (godotengine.org/license)
in your game documentation or credits would be an acceptable way to satisfy the license terms.
