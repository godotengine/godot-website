&lt;p>Today we present a showcase that is a little different. We interviewed Frederic Plourde and Daniel Castellanos who used Godot to create an educational XR experience for &lt;a href="https://somarbio.pt/">SOMAR&lt;/a>, a non-profit association focusing on the conservation of marine life in the Algarve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Frederic Plourde is the XR Lead at Collabora where he drives AR/VR strategy, business development, and open-source innovation, leading a team of talented engineers working on XR customer projects and Monado, the cross-platform open-source OpenXR runtime. He is also Vice Outreach Officer at the Khronos Group where he promotes the OpenXR standard, fosters industry collaboration, and advocates for open and interoperable XR solutions. In the SOMAR project, Frederic took on a technical leadership role, overviewing the development of an immersive XR experience and leading Collabora’s efforts toward developing a Cardboard driver for Monado.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Daniel Castellanos is the owner of Decacis Studio, and was contracted by Collabora to work mainly as a programmer/developer on the SOMAR project.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="can-you-tell-us-a-little-more-about-the-non-profit-organisation-behind-the-somar-project-who-they-are-and-what-their-mission-is">Can you tell us a little more about the non-profit organisation behind the SOMAR project, who they are and what their mission is?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong class="fred">Fred:&lt;/strong> SOMAR is a non-profit organization that focuses on protecting dolphins, whales, and marine life in the Algarve. Their mission is to raise awareness about the impact of human activities—like underwater noise pollution—on marine ecosystems. By combining scientific research, education, and innovative technology, SOMAR promotes sustainable practices and works to preserve the region’s ocean biodiversity for future generations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="can-you-tell-us-a-bit-about-the-xr-experience-you-have-created-and-what-you-set-out-to-achieve">Can you tell us a bit about the XR experience you have created, and what you set out to achieve?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong class="fred">Fred:&lt;/strong> The XR experience developed for the SOMAR project was designed to provide an immersive, educational tool to raise awareness about the impact of underwater noise pollution on marine life. By immersing users in realistic coastal and offshore environments of the Algarve, the experience showcases the effects of noise from tourist boats, particularly whale and dolphin-watching activities. Users can witness firsthand how these essential marine mammals are disrupted in their communication and hunting activities, gaining a deeper understanding of the challenges they face. Through this interactive experience, we aimed to engage users emotionally and inform them about the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect these creatures and their habitats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img alt="SOMAR selection menu" src="/storage/blog/godot-xr/somar-showcase/somar-selection-menu.webp" />&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="i-understand-the-project-is-focused-on-being-deployed-in-museums-and-in-classrooms-in-portugal-can-you-tell-us-more-about-how-this-works">I understand the project is focused on being deployed in museums and in classrooms in Portugal. Can you tell us more about how this works?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong class="fred">Fred:&lt;/strong> The SOMAR project was designed with flexibility in mind and offers content in both English and Portuguese through Godot’s built-in localization functionality. Built on OpenXR, the project benefits from a standardized framework that simplifies deployment across multiple devices, allowing us to target both museums and classrooms across Portugal. In museums and institutional venues, the Meta Quest version of the XR experience offers a high-fidelity, immersive experience with detailed visuals, allowing visitors to explore the application in a captivating, educational environment. Meanwhile, the PhoneXR version, optimized for accessibility, is intended for use in classrooms, where students can experience the same core content through low-cost &lt;a href="https://arvr.google.com/cardboard/">Google Cardboard&lt;/a>-type phone holders. By running the open-source cross-platform OpenXR runtime &lt;a href="https://monado.dev/">Monado&lt;/a> on those phones, this version is designed to be more accessible and straightforward, making it possible for kids to dive into XR for the first time, all while learning about conservation in an interactive way. This dual deployment strategy ensures that the SOMAR project can reach diverse audiences, from the general public to younger generations, fostering environmental awareness across different settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="will-the-experience-be-available-to-play-by-the-general-public-and-if-so-where-can-they-find-it">Will the experience be available to play by the general public and if so, where can they find it?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong class="fred">Fred:&lt;/strong> Yes — the SOMAR experience is now available for everyone to explore! 🐬 Dive into our open-source XR project and discover the impact of underwater noise pollution on marine life. You can download and try it out for free on &lt;a href="https://somar-project.itch.io/somar-project">SOMAR’s official itch.io page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img alt="SOMAR whale" src="/storage/blog/godot-xr/somar-showcase/somar-whale.webp" />&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-were-your-main-considerations-in-choosing-godot-as-the-xr-platform-to-create-this-experience">What were your main considerations in choosing Godot as the XR platform to create this experience?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong class="fred">Fred:&lt;/strong> One of the main considerations for selecting Godot as the game engine for this project was finding an open-source engine that could provide flexibility, scalability, and a strong support community. Godot stood out for its robust 3D capabilities, ease of use, and ability to run on multiple platforms. Godot’s open-source nature felt like a perfect match for the Monado-driven experience and our collaboration with a non-profit as part of Collabora’s 1% for the Planet initiative, reinforcing our commitment to both innovation and social impact. Additionally, Godot’s growing reputation within the XR and gaming communities, coupled with its ongoing OpenXR development via a &lt;a href="https://www.khronos.org/rfp/godot-integration">Khronos-funded project&lt;/a>, gave us confidence in its future-proof capabilities, ensuring that the SOMAR project could evolve and expand over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-was-the-most-enjoyable-part-of-using-godot">What was the most enjoyable part of using Godot?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong class="daniel">Daniel:&lt;/strong> I’ve been using Godot for a few years now, and the most enjoyable part of it for me is being able to iterate quickly. Throughout its development, the project experienced numerous revisions, but implementing these changes was generally straightforward and quick.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-was-the-most-difficult-issue-to-overcome">What was the most difficult issue to overcome?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong class="daniel">Daniel:&lt;/strong> Having a balance between creating the most realistic or immersive experience possible while having to keep the experience performant on mobile devices apart from the Quest.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="did-you-use-any-existing-toolkitsplugins-in-developing-this-experience-and-what-was-the-motivation-behind-choosing-these-or-building-your-own-solution">Did you use any existing toolkits/plugins in developing this experience and what was the motivation behind choosing these or building your own solution?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong class="daniel">Daniel:&lt;/strong> Not really! The project doesn’t feature movement, and user input is limited, so building a custom solution was not a problem. Furthermore, keeping the project as simple as possible was one of my goals, both to prevent bugs and keep the code clean and easy to understand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img alt="SOMAR boats and dolphins" src="/storage/blog/godot-xr/somar-showcase/somar-boats-dolphins.webp" />&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-would-you-like-to-see-evolve-within-godots-xr-support-that-would-have-made-building-this-project-easier">What would you like to see evolve within Godot’s XR support that would have made building this project easier?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong class="daniel">Daniel:&lt;/strong> There was a single bug or unexpected behavior that I found during development, but nothing that couldn’t be worked around. For this project, I believe Godot was the right choice and made things as easy as they could be.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="i-understand-the-project-currently-targets-the-meta-quest-headsets-what-motivated-this-choice">I understand the project currently targets the Meta Quest headsets. What motivated this choice?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong class="fred">Fred:&lt;/strong> The Meta Quest headset was chosen for the SOMAR project due to its strong popularity, excellent performance, and ease of use. As a standalone device, the Quest 3 delivers high-quality visuals and immersive experiences without needing a PC or external sensors, making it ideal for both museum venues and broader accessibility. Its widespread presence in the XR market ensures compatibility with future updates, allowing us to reach a wide audience while providing a seamless and engaging experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-was-the-experience-of-using-godot-with-the-meta-quest">How was the experience of using Godot with the Meta Quest?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong class="daniel">Daniel:&lt;/strong> Awesome! I used Meta Quest Link for most of the development to quickly test things, but every once in a while I deployed the project directly into the Meta Quest to measure performance. Fun fact: the project uses the Khronos OpenXR runtime, and it worked flawlessly first time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="i-also-understand-the-project-is-also-capable-of-using-the-monado-openxr-runtime-can-you-tell-me-a-bit-more-about-the-motivation-and-goals-of-this-port">I also understand the project is also capable of using the Monado OpenXR runtime. Can you tell me a bit more about the motivation and goals of this port?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong class="fred">Fred:&lt;/strong> The motivation behind also targeting the Monado OpenXR runtime was to ensure broader accessibility and compatibility across different platforms, particularly for low-cost, phone-based VR systems. Monado’s open-source nature aligns with our goal of creating a flexible, cost-effective solution that’s not reliant on proprietary ecosystems. For this project, Collabora dedicated engineering resources to develop a new Monado Cardboard driver, which enables the experience to run on Android phones with Cardboard VR headsets, making the immersive content accessible to a wider audience, including kids and students. This port reinforces our commitment to open standards, allowing for future enhancements and maintaining the project’s long-term sustainability.
You can find the code for that driver on the &lt;a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/bl4ckb0ne/monado/-/tree/cardboard-sdk">freedesktop.org GitLab&lt;/a>. It will be upstreamed soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="fred-specifically-for-you-can-you-give-us-a-synopsis-of-what-monado-is-and-your-perspective-on-the-combination-of-using-godot-with-monado">Fred, specifically for you, can you give us a synopsis of what Monado is and your perspective on the combination of using Godot with Monado?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong class="fred">Fred:&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://monado.dev/">Monado&lt;/a> is an open-source, cross-platform OpenXR runtime designed to provide the fundamental building blocks for XR device vendors and developers. By offering compatibility with major platforms like Linux, Windows, and Android, Monado serves as a versatile foundation for creating and deploying XR applications. Combining Monado with Godot, an open-source game engine, creates a powerful synergy. Godot’s flexibility, combined with Monado’s OpenXR support, enables both the simplicity of Godot’s development environment and the vast compatibility of Monado’s runtime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img alt="SOMAR info panels" src="/storage/blog/godot-xr/somar-showcase/somar-info-panels.webp" />&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="are-there-any-plans-to-bring-this-project-to-other-vr-headsets">Are there any plans to bring this project to other VR headsets?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong class="fred">Fred:&lt;/strong> Yep, we’re currently testing the SOMAR application on other platforms and devices. Since Monado is built on OpenXR, it’s designed to be highly adaptable and should be able to run on many other platforms and devices with minimal effort. However, as an open-source project, the real strength lies in the community. While we continue to extend support for more headsets, we encourage developers and enthusiasts to contribute to the project and help expand its reach even further. The open-source nature of Monado makes it easy for anyone to pitch in and bring support to new platforms, creating a collaborative and growing ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="whats-next-for-you-anything-interesting-on-the-horizon">What’s next for you, anything interesting on the horizon?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong class="daniel">Daniel:&lt;/strong> Sure. I’m currently working on my next game: &lt;a href="https://stellar.decacis.com/">Stellar Checkpoint&lt;/a>, which will be available in both VR and desktop/flat modes. It should come out later this year, so stay tuned!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="finally-is-there-any-advice-youd-like-to-share-especially-to-someone-considering-using-godot-for-their-next-xr-project">Finally, is there any advice you’d like to share especially to someone considering using Godot for their next XR project?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong class="fred">Fred:&lt;/strong> Absolutely! One of the most exciting things about using Godot for XR projects is the incredible community that surrounds it. Godot has such a passionate and supportive group of developers, artists, and creators, and it’s all accessible through platforms like &lt;a href="https://discord.com/invite/godotengine">the Godot Discord&lt;/a>. If you’re just getting started with XR in Godot, I highly recommend joining the Discord first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong class="daniel">Daniel:&lt;/strong> Just try it. Read the official documentation, place a couple of cubes as hands and experience how easy it is to get started! And if you get stuck, there is always someone from the community willing to help. Godot scales really well, and it works for both simple and complex projects, and best of all, being open-source means you can extend it to fit your needs.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="highlights">Highlights&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In case you missed them, see the &lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-5-dev-1/">4.5 dev 1&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-5-dev-2/">4.5 dev 2&lt;/a> release notes for an overview of some key features which were already in that snapshot, and are therefore still available for testing in dev 3.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="screen-reader-support">Screen reader support&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Accessibility should be every developer’s top priority, full-stop. Someone being excluded from an experience for factors outside of their control is an area that video games and applications have the potential to circumvent entirely. It does, however, take a solid framework to allow such accommodations to be developed. To streamline this process for everyone—players and developers alike—our resident tech guru &lt;a href="https://github.com/bruvzg">bruvzg&lt;/a> took to the absolutely Herculean task of integrating &lt;a href="https://github.com/AccessKit/accesskit">AccessKit&lt;/a> to Godot as a whole.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76829">GH-76829&lt;/a> was a project started two years ago, which progressed in bursts alongside the AccessKit framework. For the 4.5 release, we made it a priority to finalize, and thus we now merged this major feature with over &lt;strong>32,000&lt;/strong> lines of code, after hundreds of comments with feedback/testing. Users are encouraged to look at the pull request for more information, as there’s no feasible way we could properly summarize these changes. Unsurprisingly, this was &lt;em>by far&lt;/em> the change with the most ramifications of the entire snapshot, so much so that it’s already seen &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/105197">multiple&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/105216">fixes&lt;/a> to address regressions (even &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/105764">one&lt;/a> right when validating this snapshot), but it’s well worth it. After all, accessibility is our top priority!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is only the first but massive step towards making Godot more accessible. In particular for the editor, a lot more work will be needed to make it really usable, as well as integrate with accessibility frameworks for mobile or web platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="script-backtracing">Script backtracing&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In any other snapshot, this would’ve been the main highlight, as adding backtracing to GDScript was among the most highly requested features from our users for years. Two brave souls, &lt;a href="https://github.com/mihe">Mikael Hermansson&lt;/a> (godot-jolt) and &lt;a href="https://github.com/reduz">Juan Linietsky&lt;/a> (up-and-coming developer), helmed this task and made this process possible with &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/91006">GH-91006&lt;/a>. This will make it much easier for users to find the cause of warnings/errors that previously required manually hunting down bugs. Stack traces are now available in projects exported in release mode as well if the &lt;strong>Debug &amp;gt; Settings &amp;gt; GDScript &amp;gt; Always Track Call Stacks&lt;/strong> project setting is enabled. This can make it easier for users to report issues in a way that developers can track down.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="inspector-section-toggles">Inspector section toggles&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Another long-awaited feature, inspector section toggles, is now a part of the engine as of &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/105272">GH-105272&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://github.com/lodetrick">lodetrick&lt;/a> has expanded editor functionality to what you see below: sections with their own dedicated checkbox to denote if they’re enabled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/storage/blog/dev-snapshot-godot-4-5-dev-3/inspector-checkboxes.webp" alt="Inspector checkboxes" />&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You fools. You underestimate the passion of our community yet again, as &lt;strong>250&lt;/strong> improvements are ready to roll for this snapshot. What’s more is that, unlike last time, we’re not &lt;em>just&lt;/em> in bugfix territory any more. Now the time for proper enhancements and features entirely unique to this development cycle has come, and this blogpost will aim to highlight them to the best of our ability. As always: with new features comes new bugs (probably), so the sooner we can get feedback and bug reports in, the better.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="highlights">Highlights&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In case you missed them, see the &lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-5-dev-1/">4.5 dev 1&lt;/a> release notes for an overview of some key features which were already in that snapshot, and are therefore still available for testing in dev 2.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dedicated-2d-navigation-server">Dedicated 2D navigation server&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For the longest time, the navigation server was a unified beast. 3D and 2D, Yin and Yang, two sides of the same coin. While beautiful on a philosophical level and undoubtedly a heart-wrenching screenplay waiting to happen, it was a pretty sour deal for the 2D side of things. Previously, if you were making a 2D game and wanted to make use of navigational features, you were effectively locked into a bunch of 3D settings and features that would never see any use but would &lt;em>absolutely&lt;/em> see a bump in output size.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Steps have been taken during this initial 4.5 period to ensure that navigation logic is more cleanly divided and organized, spearheaded by our navigation guru &lt;a href="https://github.com/smix8">smix8&lt;/a>, but none of this could’ve been possible without cleanly splitting the navigation server in twain. Longtime contributor &lt;a href="https://github.com/AThousandShips">AThousandShips&lt;/a> took the mantle on this project, and she successfully accomplished this goal with &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/101504">GH-101504&lt;/a>. From now on, users will be able to selectively enable/disable the navigation modules for 2D and/or 3D, instead of being forced into an all-or-nothing ultimatum.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="reorganized-shader-editor-ui">Reorganized shader editor UI&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The editor experience for shaders and visual shaders got some &lt;abbr title="Tender loving care">TLC&lt;/abbr> in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/100287">GH-100287&lt;/a>. Helmed by &lt;a href="https://github.com/Chaosus">Yuri Rubinsky&lt;/a>, this PR provides several requested features and QOL updates to our shading friends. Below is a preview image taken directly from the PR in question, where you’ll find more information on what to expect when you get your hands on it this snapshot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/storage/blog/dev-snapshot-godot-4-5-dev-2/shader-editor.webp" alt="Updated shader editor UI" />&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="changing-editor-language-without-restart">Changing editor language without restart&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Godot has built-in support for handling multiple languages, both for the games you create and the editor itself. However, in contrast to games built with the engine, it wasn’t possible to change the current language on-the-fly within the editor itself. Our editor expert &lt;a href="https://github.com/KoBeWi">Tomasz Chabora&lt;/a> addressed this issue in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/102562">GH-102562&lt;/a>, ensuring that users can swap to their preferred language within the same editor session! While this is somewhat niche in practice, our stance on convenience and accessibility is one that we take very seriously, and a seamless/streamlined editor experience is exactly the sort of thing we want as many users as possible to enjoy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="fragment-density-map-support">Fragment density map support&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When rendering for VR headsets, the pixels around the outside of the viewport are less important, because they will be somewhat distorted by the lens, and players will tend to turn their head rather than move their eyes too far from the center.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Godot already supports using the Vulkan “Fragment Shading Rate” extension to render the outside of the viewport at a lower resolution, leading to performance improvements with little noticeable decrease in quality. However, on standalone VR headsets (like the Meta Quest), this extension either isn’t supported, or doesn’t provide as big performance improvements as the Vulkan “Fragment Density Map” extension.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99551">GH-99551&lt;/a>, rendering expert &lt;a href="https://github.com/DarioSamo">DarioSamo&lt;/a> has implemented support for the “Fragment Density Map” extension, making the Vulkan Mobile renderer more viable for VR on standalone headsets.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wayland-native-sub-window-support">Wayland: Native sub-window support&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Thanks to the tireless efforts of &lt;a href="https://github.com/Riteo">Riteo&lt;/a>, the X11 alternative &lt;a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland&lt;/a> has been given first-class treatment on Godot. It’s been a long road to stand as an equal to such a dominant display server protocol, but it’s getting closer with every passing PR; though some have been hesitant to make the change for one reason: lack of native sub-windows. Taking on this hurdle for parity was no small feat, but it was a requirement for supporting embedded game windows on Wayland, so (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/101774">GH-101774&lt;/a>) made it happen all the same:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/storage/blog/dev-snapshot-godot-4-5-dev-2/wayland-sub-window.webp" alt="Multi-Window output on Wayland" />&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="and-more">And more!&lt;/h3>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2D: Optimize usability of VisibleOnScreenNotifier2D (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/100874">GH-100874&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Animation: Add selection box movement/scaling to the animation bezier editor (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/100470">GH-100470&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Core: Optimize &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Object::cast_to&lt;/code> by assuming no virtual and multiple inheritance, gaining 7x throughput over &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dynamic_cast&lt;/code> (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/103708">GH-103708&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Editor: Remove New prefix from EditorResourcePicker (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/104604">GH-104604&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Export: Updates and fixes to the Android prebuilt export logic (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/103173">GH-103173&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GDScript: Return early when parsing invalid super call (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/104509">GH-104509&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GUI: Improve Popup &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content_scale_factor&lt;/code> (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/104399">GH-104399&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GUI: Optimize startup times by using &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ubrk_clone&lt;/code> instead of &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ubrk_open&lt;/code> (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/104455">GH-104455&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GUI: Scroll &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EditorInspector&lt;/code> while drag &amp;amp; drop hovering near the edges (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/103943">GH-103943&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>

It was organised by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BastiaanOlij">Bastiaan Olij&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MalcolmANixon">Malcolm Nixon&lt;/a> acting in their roles as representatives of the general Godot XR Community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was a week-long event in which developers had to create an XR application using the theme “Enchanted”. XR has great potential on this topic, whether you interpret this as physical spell casting, a magical environment, or something else, and the entries did not disappoint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compared to our previous game jam, we went from 26 entries and 283 ratings to 27 entries and 290 ratings. Not a great jump, however we had 125 people join this game jam compared to 77 in our previous jam.
Based on feedback we’ve received on our Discord channel, the main reason the higher participation did not translate to more entries was due to a number of participants not finishing their entry in time. We’ve had overwhelmingly positive feedback on the experience with many new developers becoming active members in our XR community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While subjective, the overall quality of the entries seems to have been a lot higher than the previous jam so we are really looking forward to what the future will bring.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="top-5">Top 5&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let’s take a closer look at the top 5 entries!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="no-5-syneed">No 5. Syneed&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam-feb-2025/rate/3332396">Syneed&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://hiina.itch.io/">Hiina&lt;/a> ranked 5th with 13 ratings (Score: 3.705).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our fifth place entry is a puzzle game where you need to manipulate a stream of particles using attractors.
By adjusting these within the world, the trajectory of the particles changes and you can guide them past a number of stars.
The goal is for the particle stream to touch all stars.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="no-4-keziahs-house">No 4. Keziah’s House&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam-feb-2025/rate/3331240">Keziah’s House&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://warpingrealities.itch.io/">Warping Realities VR&lt;/a> ranked 4th with 12 ratings (Score: 3.764).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our fourth place goes to this great escape room game.
You find yourself waking up trapped in a derelict old house.
Solve puzzles while casting magic spells to find your way out.&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16/9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EK75Raq0i7c" title="Keziah's House" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;h3 id="no-3-the-chant-of-cthulhu">No 3. The Chant of Cthulhu&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam-feb-2025/rate/3322870">The Chant of Cthulhu&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://copper-tunic.itch.io/">Copper Tunic&lt;/a> ranked 3rd with 12 ratings (Score: 3.833).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our third place is a horror karaoke game.
You need to sing out loud the chants given and as you do so, more and more “clones” are created that repeat your words.
As everything reaches a crescendo, you summon the monsters of the deep.
All within a church environment that fits the concept well.
Very good use of recording and sound and with a freeplay mode you can extend the fun by manually placing clones that sing out your recorded song.&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16/9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Yxv9bE2sIQ" title="The Chant of Cthulhu" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;h3 id="no-2-ez-enchants">No 2. EZ Enchants&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam-feb-2025/rate/3316696">EZ Enchants&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://dragon1freak.itch.io/">Dragon1Freak&lt;/a> ranked 2nd with 12 ratings (Score: 3.931).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our runner-up is a fun little crafting game.
As customers walk past your little magic store, they ask you to enchant different objects.
You have to perform different actions according to the customer’s wishes, all within a time limit.
A very polished, good looking entry that is fun to play!&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="no-1-your-hand-is-a-dragon-xr">No 1. Your Hand Is A Dragon (XR)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam-feb-2025/rate/3332432">Your Hand Is A Dragon (XR)&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://andyman404.itch.io/">Andyman404&lt;/a> ranked 1st with 10 ratings (Score: 4.020).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our winning entry is a very distinct game, as we’ve come to expect from Andyman404.
You play as a dragon that attacks fortresses manned by knights.
What makes it unique is that you control the dragon with your hand as if it is a sockpuppet,
while simultaneously roaring out loud to make the dragon breathe fire.
It’s especially impressive as Andyman404 only had 3 days to dedicate to this entry.&lt;/p>

If you haven’t seen the &lt;a href="/releases/4.4/">&lt;strong>4.4 release page&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, it’s well worth a read!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then, we’ve started the development phase for Godot 4.5 at full speed (with a first &lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-5-dev-1/">dev snapshot&lt;/a> released last week!), but we also put our main focus on fixing remaining and newly reported regressions that affect users who upgraded to 4.4. A few of these issues can be showstoppers for affected users, so we decided to release a 4.4.1 maintenance release as soon as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See below for a list of the most relevant changes. This release includes fixes to &lt;a href="https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/releases/tag/mbedtls-3.6.3">security vulnerabilities&lt;/a> in the mbedTLS third-party library, so we strongly recommend updating for any game using networking functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maintenance releases are expected to be safe for an upgrade, but we recommend to always make backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please, consider &lt;a href="#support">supporting the project financially&lt;/a>, if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors. Your donations go towards sponsoring their work and ensuring they can dedicate their undivided attention to the needs of the project.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="known-incompatibilities">Known incompatibilities&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As of now, there are no known incompatibilities with the previous Godot 4.4 release. &lt;strong>We encourage all users to upgrade to 4.4.1.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you experience any unexpected behavior change in your projects after upgrading to 4.4.1, please &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues">file an issue on GitHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bug-reports">Bug reports&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a tester, we encourage you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues">open bug reports&lt;/a> if you experience issues with this release. Please check the &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues">existing issues on GitHub&lt;/a> first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in this snapshot).&lt;/p>

If you haven’t seen the &lt;a href="/releases/4.4/">&lt;strong>4.4 release page&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, it’s well worth a read!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then, we’ve started the development phase for Godot 4.5 at full speed (with a first &lt;a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-5-dev-1/">dev snapshot&lt;/a> released yesterday!), but we also put our main focus on fixing remaining and newly reported regressions that affect users who upgraded to 4.4. A few of these issues can be showstoppers for affected users, so we decided to release a 4.4.1 maintenance release as soon as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a first &lt;a href="/article/release-candidate-godot-4-4-1-rc-1/">4.4.1-rc1 snapshot&lt;/a> last week, we decided to make a second release candidate as a few more critical bugs had fixes available to backport. Please test it if you can and report any new issue that was not present in 4.4-stable, as we want to ensure we don’t introduce new regressions in this hotfix release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maintenance releases are expected to be safe for an upgrade, but we recommend to always make backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please, consider &lt;a href="#support">supporting the project financially&lt;/a>, if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors. Your donations go towards sponsoring their work and ensuring they can dedicate their undivided attention to the needs of the project.&lt;/p>

In truth, the quantity has been &lt;em>so&lt;/em> great that we could’ve gotten away with releasing a snapshot a week ago! However,
we found it worth our time to hold out and get as many contributions integrated as possible, as a way of thanking those
who’ve been so patient in waiting for their contributions to see the light of day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A significant chunk of the changes in this release are bugfixes, the majority of which you will be see backported to
4.4 in a 4.4.1-stable release next week! As such, we encourage testing this build in order to ensure a smooth release for both
versions. Granted, as this &lt;em>is&lt;/em> a pre-release, the bugfixes aren’t the only additions; the usual safety precautions
that come with such an environment should be taken. Even though we prepare these snapshots such that they’re suitable
for general testing, backups and/or version control are recommended to prevent the loss of data.&lt;/p>

Developed by &lt;a href="https://nachogames.itch.io/">Nachosama Games&lt;/a>, the game was recently released &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3431040/Thats_not_my_Neighbor/?curator_clanid=41324400">on Steam&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="mute-game-toggle">“Mute Game” toggle&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Previously, if a developer wished to mute the audio while testing in the editor, they had to either use the operating
system’s builtin tools for sound or outright pause/close their work. &lt;a href="https://github.com/Meorge">Malcolm Anderson&lt;/a> sought
a more streamlined solution, and integrated a new toggle on the Game view (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99555">GH-99555&lt;/a>). Now if developers wish to halt/restore audio
output entirely, it’s just one click away!&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="drop-preload-resources-as-uid">Drop preload Resources as &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UID&lt;/code>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>With &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UID&lt;/code> support being a part of the engine as of 4.4—read more about them &lt;a href="/article/uid-changes-coming-to-godot-4-4/">here&lt;/a>—we’ve enabled further optimizations via their integration with core components. However, as this is a new change, there’s still a few areas that have been lagging behind on support. In particular: preloaded resources lacked the ability to be loaded as &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UID&lt;/code> if dragged. &lt;a href="https://github.com/KoBeWi">Tomasz Chabora&lt;/a> has rectified this limitation in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99094">GH-99094&lt;/a>, and you’ll find plenty more like this in our curated selection below.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A long-awaited QOL addition to the editor experience has finally arrived! Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/YeldhamDev">Michael Alexsander&lt;/a>, developers now have the ability to select multiple nodes in a runtime context! Check out their pull request &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99680">GH-99680&lt;/a> for more information on how this was integrated.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The current implementation of &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TileMapLayer&lt;/code> uses individual collision bodies for every single cell, which is extremely wasteful and a likely cause of runtime performance issues for 2D scenes relying on physics. &lt;a href="https://github.com/groud">Gilles Roudière&lt;/a> took to entirely reworking this system in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/102662">GH-102662&lt;/a>, ensuring that cells take every possible opportunity.&lt;/p>

If you haven’t seen the &lt;a href="/releases/4.4/">&lt;strong>4.4 release page&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, it’s well worth a read!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then, we’ve started the development phase for Godot 4.5 at full speed, but we also put our main focus on fixing remaining and newly reported regressions that affect users who upgraded to 4.4. A few of these issues can be showstoppers for affected users, so we decided to release a 4.4.1 maintenance release as soon as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here’s a release candidate to validate this series of fixes and help ensure that Godot 4.4 is fully suitable for everyone. Please test it if you can and report any new issue that was not present in 4.4-stable, as we want to ensure we don’t introduce new regressions in this hotfix release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maintenance releases are expected to be safe for an upgrade, but we recommend to always make backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please, consider &lt;a href="#support">supporting the project financially&lt;/a>, if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors. Your donations go towards sponsoring their work and ensuring they can dedicate their undivided attention to the needs of the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="#downloads">Jump to the &lt;strong>Downloads&lt;/strong> section&lt;/a>, and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also &lt;a href="https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.4.1.rc1/">try the &lt;strong>Web editor&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> or the &lt;strong>Android editor&lt;/strong> for this release.

&lt;p>We are pleased to announce the release of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/godot-sdk-integrations/godot-meta-toolkit">Godot Meta Toolkit&lt;/a>, a GDExtension plugin that exposes Meta’s &lt;a href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/native/ps-platform-intro">Platform SDK&lt;/a> and provides other tools to simplify and accelerate XR development on Meta’s platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project is Open Source (MIT license) and maintained by &lt;a href="https://www.w4games.com/">W4 Games&lt;/a> with sponsorship from Meta. Contributions from the community are welcome! 🙂&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can download version 1.0.2 &lt;a href="https://github.com/godot-sdk-integrations/godot-meta-toolkit/releases/tag/1.0.2-stable">from GitHub&lt;/a> or the &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/3673">Asset Library&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s take a look at the features available in this release!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="platform-sdk">Platform SDK&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Platform SDK allows developers to access features of Meta’s store and online services, including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>User profiles (including authentication and checking entitlement)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In-App Purchases (IAP)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Downloadable Content (DLC)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Friends, Parties, and Group Presence&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Achievements&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leaderboards&lt;/li>
&lt;li>… and much more!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Support of the Platform SDK in the Godot Meta Toolkit is done using code generation, which automatically generates the Godot classes by processing the &lt;a href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/downloads/package/oculus-platform-sdk/">Platform SDK’s official C headers&lt;/a>. This approach simplifies keeping the Godot Meta Toolkit up-to-date with the latest updates to the Platform SDK, and provides Godot APIs that match the Platform SDK’s C, Unity, and Unreal APIs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As of version 1.0.2, the Godot Meta Toolkit supports v72 of the Platform SDK.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See &lt;a href="https://godot-sdk-integrations.github.io/godot-meta-toolkit/manual/platform_sdk/getting_started.html">the “Getting Started” guide in the documentation&lt;/a> for more information!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="setup-tool-for-xr-simulator">Setup Tool for XR Simulator&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/xrsim-intro">Meta XR Simulator&lt;/a> is the counterpart of the &lt;a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/godot-game-engine/7713660705416473/">Godot XR Editor&lt;/a> as it allows developers to test XR applications directly on their computer (Windows or macOS), removing the need to constantly put the headset on and off, thus leading to faster iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Godot editor can be configured to launch the Meta XR Simulator when you run your game, and the Godot Meta Toolkit includes a tool to help you with that configuration!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img alt="Configure XR simulator" src="/storage/blog/godot-xr/xr_simulator_tool.webp" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See &lt;a href="https://godot-sdk-integrations.github.io/godot-meta-toolkit/manual/xr_simulator.html">the “XR Simulator” documentation&lt;/a> for more information!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="easily-configure-exports-for-meta-quest-headsets">Easily configure exports for Meta Quest headsets&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When exporting your game for a Meta Quest headset, in particular, if you want to release on the HorizonOS store, there are a number of specific, required export settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Godot Meta Toolkit provides a new export option that, if checked, will automatically configure these settings to their required values.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img alt="Enable toolkit" src="/storage/blog/godot-xr/enable_toolkit.webp" />&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="openxr-vendors-plugin-312-release">OpenXR Vendors plugin 3.1.2 release&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Here comes another release of the Godot OpenXR Vendors plugin with plenty of features and bug fixes!
This release of the OpenXR vendors plugin is for Godot 4.3 and later only.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can download version 3.1.2 from &lt;a href="https://github.com/GodotVR/godot_openxr_vendors/releases/tag/3.1.2-stable">GitHub&lt;/a> or the &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/3076">Asset Library&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, the XR sample projects are also available on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/GodotVR/godot_openxr_vendors/releases/tag/3.1.2-stable">GitHub release&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset?filter=XR+Sample&amp;amp;category=&amp;amp;godot_version=&amp;amp;cost=&amp;amp;sort=updated">Asset Library&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="features">Features&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Update OpenXR to Khronos 1.1.41 release&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the option to enable hand tracking on Pico devices
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Add support for toggling the hand tracking frequency on Pico devices between &lt;em>LOW&lt;/em> and &lt;em>HIGH&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xr/openxr/extensions/automatically_request_runtime_permissions&lt;/code> project setting to enable/disable automatic requests for runtime permissions
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The project setting is enabled by default, which causes all runtime permissions to be requested at app launch&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Developers can disable that behavior so that application logic can request the permissions in a context-specific manner&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add export profile for Magic Leap 2 devices&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Update the signal emitted by &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OpenXRFbSpatialEntity.erase_from_storage()&lt;/code> from &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_on_save_to_storage&lt;/code> to &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_on_erase_from_storage&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only add the &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#CATEGORY_LAUNCHER">Android LAUNCHER category&lt;/a> to the generated XR binary if the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">package/show_in_app_library&lt;/code> export option is enabled&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fix wall, floor, and ceiling collision shapes with Jolt physics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add export option to enable or disable sharing of Meta’s spatial anchors
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This adds the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">com.oculus.permission.IMPORT_EXPORT_IOT_MAP_DATA&lt;/code> permission when enabled&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fix a crash that happens when a spatial anchor is created before the OpenXR session has begun&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reworked geometric algebra used by Meta body tracking extension to address root and shoulder tracking bugs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remove deprecated “Contextual” boundary mode on Meta Quest&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fix &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OpenXRFbPassthroughExtensionWrapper&lt;/code> from wiping out the next pointer chain for system properties&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fix passthrough sample color map display bug&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fix the issue preventing vendor options in the export preset from being updated&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="godot-xr-tools-440-release">Godot XR Tools 4.4.0 release&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>This version of XR Tools has been updated to contain &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-2-arrives-in-style/#critical-and-breaking-changes">Godot 4.2 mesh formats&lt;/a> and thus &lt;strong>requires Godot 4.2+&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can download version 4.4.0 from &lt;a href="https://github.com/GodotVR/godot-xr-tools/releases">GitHub&lt;/a> or the &lt;a href="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1698">Asset Library&lt;/a>.
You can download &lt;a href="https://godot-xr.itch.io/godot-xr-tools-demo">the Godot XR Tools demo on itch.io&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Godot XR Tools repository on GitHub contains a &lt;a href="https://github.com/GodotVR/godot-xr-tools/blob/master/.github/workflows/publish-demo-on-push.yaml">GitHub workflow&lt;/a> that prepares and uploads the demo project to the above itch.io page. This workflow can be used as a template for your own project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="features-1">Features&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The StartXR startup script has had a cleanup pass, it now:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Properly handles the passthrough system changes in Godot 4.3. Godot 4.3 saw changes in basing passthrough on the environment blend mode and moved logic into the vendor plugin to improve platform support for passthrough. XR Tools now makes use of this new system.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add proper support for the immersive-ar and immersive-vr webXR modes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provides signals to notify when the user enters or exits XR&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://godotvr.github.io/godot-xr-tools/docs/pickable/">Pickable objects&lt;/a> now include an &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">action_released&lt;/code> signal so additional logic can be written when objects are dropped by the user&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allow &lt;a href="https://godotvr.github.io/godot-xr-tools/docs/grab_point/">grab-points&lt;/a> and poses to work with different types of hand trackers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;a href="https://godotvr.github.io/godot-xr-tools/docs/vignette/">vignette shader&lt;/a> now works properly in Godot 4 including support for reverse-Z depth buffers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">visibility_changed&lt;/code> notifications to &lt;a href="https://godotvr.github.io/godot-xr-tools/docs/pointer/">Viewport2Din3D&lt;/a> hosted scenes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add &lt;em>SnapPath&lt;/em>, a new snap object that allows you to snap objects along a path and at fixed intervals&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="bug-fixes-1">Bug fixes&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fix custom hand poses calling legacy &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">remove_animation&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Invisible &lt;a href="https://godotvr.github.io/godot-xr-tools/docs/pointer/">Viewport2Din3D&lt;/a> now disable physics and viewport updates&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improvements to collision hands so collision shapes of picked up objects are added and we no longer have hands collide with dropped objects&lt;/li>

As we are in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate">Release Candidate&lt;/a> stage and focus only on critical regression fixes, the pace of merging pull requests has nearly stopped… but a lot of good stuff is already being queued for the next release cycle. In the meantime, the communication team is doing an amazing work to finalize the contents of the release page, so that you can all (re)discover the highlights of Godot 4.4 with an exciting format!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We managed to get a few more regressions identified and fixed since our RC2 snapshot 2 days ago, so we’re making a &lt;em>final&lt;/em> final release candidate to round this all up and ensure Godot 4.4 is ready for prime time!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please, consider &lt;a href="#support">supporting the project financially&lt;/a>, if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors.

&lt;h2 id="known-issues">Known issues&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>During the Release Candidate stage, we focus exclusively on solving showstopping regressions (i.e. something that worked in a previous release is now broken, without workaround). You can have a look at our current &lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/godotengine/projects/61">list of regressions and significant issues&lt;/a> which we aim to address before releasing 4.4. This list is dynamic and will be updated if we discover new blocking issues after more users start testing the RC snapshots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With every release, we are aware that there are going to be various issues which have already been reported but haven’t been fixed yet, due to limited resources. See the GitHub issue tracker for a complete list of &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+">known bugs&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in this snapshot).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Godot is a non-profit, open source game engine developed by hundreds of contributors on their free time, as well as a handful of part and full-time developers hired thanks to &lt;a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/">generous donations from the Godot community&lt;/a>. A big thank you to everyone who has contributed &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/AUTHORS.md">their time&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/DONORS.md">their financial support&lt;/a> to the project!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’d like to support the project financially and help us secure our future hires, you can do so using the &lt;a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/">Godot Development Fund&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Please, consider &lt;a href="#support">supporting the project financially&lt;/a>, if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors.

That’s the idea behind The Museum of All Things, a free and open-source procedurally-generated museum built on Wikipedia’s vast knowledge base.</summary><description>&lt;p>What if Wikipedia was a place you could visit? That’s the idea behind &lt;a href="https://may.as/moat">The Museum of All Things&lt;/a>, a &lt;a href="https://github.com/m4ym4y/museum-of-all-things">free and open-source&lt;/a> procedurally-generated museum built on Wikipedia’s vast knowledge base.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this interview, we talk to &lt;a href="https://may.as">Maya&lt;/a>, the creator of The Museum of All Things, about the challenges of turning an entire encyclopedia into an walkable space, why she chose Godot for development, and how VR transformed the project into something even more immersive.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="can-you-tell-us-a-little-bit-about-your-project">Can you tell us a little bit about your project?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Museum of All Things (or the MoAT) is a free virtual museum that lets you explore any topic you can imagine! It does this by procedurally generating its exhibits using Wikipedia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every exhibit you enter in the museum corresponds to an article on Wikipedia. Text and images from the Wikipedia article cover the walls of the exhibit, and you can find hallways leading to other related exhibits based on the links in the exhibit’s Wikipedia article.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/storage/blog/moat/peach.webp" alt="A screenshot of the museum (article: Peach)" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve been making video games for most of my life, but The Museum of All Things is the biggest game I’ve made so far. It’s also my first real 3D game. I have prototypes of the game going back a few years, but I started really working on this iteration in November 2024.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ever since I was a kid I’ve loved museums, so being able to make my own museum is so exciting to me. I love that the skills of game development let me create a project like this, even though it’s outside the traditional genres of video games.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-were-some-of-the-biggest-challenges-you-faced-during-the-development-process-and-how-did-you-overcome-them">What were some of the biggest challenges you faced during the development process, and how did you overcome them?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The hardest part of this project has been turning something as huge as Wikipedia into a procedurally-generated space that makes sense and is fun to explore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Museum of All Things has about the same square footage as Philadelphia based on my rough calculation. It’s different from most procedurally-generated worlds because all the text and images displayed in that whole area are actually unique. But it’s still really hard to make all of that area interesting to the player.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve worked hard on adding interest to the museum, and on making the museum feel more like a physical space. I’m using &lt;a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/3d/using_gridmaps.html">Godot’s GridMap feature&lt;/a> to randomly generate a unique floorplan for every exhibit. The exhibit generation is seeded, so everyone is visiting the same version of each exhibit. There are several different interior themes used in the exhibits to add visual variety. Ambient sounds and music create an atmosphere. And in addition to the images and text pulled from Wikipedia to fill the exhibits, the museum also pulls images from &lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a> to make exhibits larger and
more interesting to explore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="/storage/blog/moat/chongqing.webp" alt="A screenshot of the museum (article: Chongqing)" />&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-project-is-under-the-mit-license-and-available-for-everyone-at-github-what-made-you-decide-to-make-the-project-free-and-open-source">The project is under the MIT license and available for everyone &lt;a href="https://github.com/m4ym4y/museum-of-all-things">at GitHub&lt;/a>. What made you decide to make the project free and open source?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This project would have been totally impossible without the wealth of knowledge compiled by Wikipedia’s community and the APIs which Wikimedia makes freely available. So I really want my project to pay that goodwill forward as much as I can. And the beauty of this museum being a virtual experience is that there’s no space to rent or building to upkeep, so I can afford to make it free!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-did-you-discover-godot-what-made-you-pick-it-for-your-project">How did you discover Godot? What made you pick it for your project?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I discovered Godot a few years ago when I was looking for an engine to use for a game jam, and I had a good experience with it! Using open-source tools is really important to me, because I don’t want to learn skills that could become obsolete if a company decides to change their pricing model. The cross-platform support was a big selling point to me as well!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve used Godot several more times for game jams (most of my &lt;a href="https://ldjam.com/users/maymay/games">Ludum Dare entries&lt;/a> are in Godot). I’ve gotten more comfortable with the features and workflow now, so Godot was the first tool I reached for when I started prototyping my museum!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-museum-can-be-visited-in-vr-how-was-your-experience-implementing-vr-with-godot">The museum can be visited in VR. How was your experience implementing VR with Godot?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I was really intimidated by VR, but I actually found it to be straightforward! I didn’t go into this project knowing anything about developing in VR, so the &lt;a href="https://github.com/GodotVR/godot-xr-tools">godot-xr-tools&lt;/a> addon was extremely helpful. All the elements like movement and interaction came out of the box and fit into the game world I had written.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m really happy that I took the leap and added VR. For a project like this where the objective is just to explore a world, VR makes a big difference in the experience. I went from thinking “hey I made a cool game” to thinking “wow I created a world that I can actually visit.” And that’s kinda the coolest feeling ever for me.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="how-can-people-visit-the-museum">How can people visit the museum?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can download the Museum of All Things for free on Windows, Linux, or macOS! If you have a headset compatible with OpenXR (the Oculus Quest is not supported currently) you can download the OpenXR release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can visit the project’s official homepage at &lt;a href="https://may.as/moat">https://may.as/moat&lt;/a> or download the &lt;a href="https://mayeclair.itch.io/museum-of-all-things">Museum of All Things from Itch.io&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="do-you-have-any-other-projects-in-mind-for-the-future">Do you have any other projects in mind for the future?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I’m waiting for another idea to come along that captures my attention. I’m working on my art and writing skills, so I think my next game may be something that includes more of a story. I’ll probably be participating in game jams too!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m going to be taking a break from working on the Musuem of All Things, but I want to return to it and publish updates in the future too. There are big features that I’d still like to add – for example the ability to visit the museum with others in multiplayer is something many people have requested. I’d also like to add more variety to the museum’s layout, and maybe the ability to pull in more types of content from Wikimedia where available, such as audio and 3D models. It’s one of these projects where every time I touch it there’s more things I want to add.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But without very extensive testing from the community, we can never be 100% sure that the release is ready to be published as a recommended stable upgrade for all users. With this candidate, Godot 4.4 is now ready for testing to upgrade existing projects (but always make a copy or version control commit before upgrading!), and we’re eager to hear how it fares and whether any new major issues have been left unnoticed until now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please, consider &lt;a href="#support">supporting the project financially&lt;/a>, if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors. Your donations go towards sponsoring their work and ensuring they can dedicate their undivided attention to the needs of the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="#downloads">Jump to the &lt;strong>Downloads&lt;/strong> section&lt;/a>, and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also &lt;a href="https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.4.rc1/">try the &lt;strong>Web editor&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> or the &lt;strong>Android editor&lt;/strong> for this release.

&lt;h2 id="changelog">Changelog&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As we released 4.4 beta 4 just days ago, and tightened a lot our policy on what kind of changes can be merged leading to the release candidate stage, there aren’t a lot of changes in this snapshot. &lt;strong>12 contributors&lt;/strong> (at this stage, release heroes!) submitted &lt;strong>18 fixes&lt;/strong> for this release. See our &lt;a href="https://godotengine.github.io/godot-interactive-changelog/#4.4-rc1">&lt;strong>interactive changelog&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> for the complete list of changes since the 4.4-beta4 snapshot. You can also review &lt;a href="https://godotengine.github.io/godot-interactive-changelog/#4.4">all changes included in 4.4&lt;/a> compared to the previous 4.3 feature release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This release is built from commit &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/8ed125b42908d0d46d3b8967e3a3bc03f809b3af">&lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8ed125b42&lt;/code>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

While engine maintainers try their best to ensure that each preview snapshot and release candidate is stable, this is by definition &lt;strong>a pre-release piece of software&lt;/strong>. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="known-issues">Known issues&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>During the Release Candidate stage, we focus exclusively on solving showstopping regressions (i.e. something that worked in a previous release is now broken, without workaround). You can have a look at our current &lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/godotengine/projects/61">list of regressions and significant issues&lt;/a> which we aim to address before releasing 4.4. This list is dynamic and will be updated if we discover new blocking issues after more users start testing the RC snapshots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Edit:&lt;/em> A regression was introduced in this snapshot and will be fixed in RC 2:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The change to the &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rendering/rendering_device/driver&lt;/code> project setting and its platform overrides to default to a new &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">auto&lt;/code> mode in &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/103026">GH-103026&lt;/a> caused a regression in the Android and iOS export process, where some necessary configuration is no longer set properly (&lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/103156">GH-103156&lt;/a>). You can work it around by explicitly setting &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rendering/rendering_device/driver.android&lt;/code> to &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vulkan&lt;/code> and &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rendering/rendering_device/driver.ios&lt;/code> to &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">metal&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>With every release, we are aware that there are going to be various issues which have already been reported but haven’t been fixed yet, due to limited resources. See the GitHub issue tracker for a complete list of &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+">known bugs&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bug-reports">Bug reports&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a tester, we encourage you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues">open bug reports&lt;/a> if you experience issues with this release. Please check the &lt;a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues">existing issues on GitHub&lt;/a> first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in this snapshot).&lt;/p>

As such, you can expect this to be our final beta release of the 4.4 period, with release candidates set to come out shortly after. In practice, this means that all further changes will be &lt;em>strictly&lt;/em> regression fixes, so the content available here will be largely reflective of the 4.4 release. As always, users are strongly encouraged to test this snapshot to catch the remaining few release blockers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please, consider &lt;a href="#support">supporting the project financially&lt;/a>, if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors. Your donations go towards sponsoring their work and ensuring they can dedicate their undivided attention to the needs of the project.&lt;/p>
