<hr />

<p>As announced <a href="/article/meet-community-godotcon-poznan-2019">a few months back</a>, we are organizing a Godot Conference (<strong>GodotCon</strong>) in <strong>Poznań, Poland</strong> next week, on 16 &amp; 17 Oct 2019. We expect close to 90 attendees, so this should be a great event!</p>

<p>Thanks again to the organizers of the <a href="https://gic.gd">Game Industry Conference</a> for hosting us as a pre-GIC event, as well as hosting the <strong>Godot Sprint</strong> on 14 &amp; 15 Oct at the same venue, where engine contributors will meet to work together, discuss the roadmap for 4.0 and future releases and many other technical topics :)</p>

<p>Below you will find the preliminary schedule for GodotCon Poznań, as well as a short description of the talks and the speakers. The order of the talks is still likely to change, and a few more talks may be added as we often get last minute proposals (especially from core contributors who tend to prefer making Pull Requests over preparing talks ;)).</p>

<p><strong>Note for GodotCon attendees:</strong> Always refer to the <strong><a href="https://godotengine.org/events">Events page</a></strong> when in doubt about specifics regarding the event (time, location). We’ll update this page in priority whenever there is new details (especially more precise indications about how to find the conference room).</p>

<p>For people who cannot attend GodotCon, do not despair―we plan to have a livestream on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GodotEngineOfficial/live">Godot’s YouTube channel</a>, which will also be available in replay.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2019-10-16:</strong> Here is the current schedule with time table: <strong><a href="/storage/app/media/events/godotcon-2019/Program%20GodotCon%20Poznan.pdf">Link to PDF</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Livesteam of the event is <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GodotEngineOfficial/live">online on YouTube</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Note: This is currently an unordered list of talks we will have. This post will be updated with a plan for <em>when</em> each talk should be in coming days.</p>

<ul>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <ul>
      <li>Juan will show us the current state of the (work-in-progress) Vulkan branch, and explain how it was designed and the main differences with the Godot 3.x backend. He will show new features such as the reworked Global Illumination probes, anisotropy, and how a project like the <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/tps-demo">TPS demo</a> fares on Vulkan.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <table>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <ul>
      <li>At <a href="https://www.gdquest.com">GDQuest</a>, we’ve learned to make free software creating small demos, tools, and tutorials for the community. This year was essential for us as we focused on complex projects and learned to work as a team. The next step is to build free and open-source games that both go beyond entertainment and benefit the community. Everyone is welcome to join us on this journey to become better game developers and create meaningful projects together.</li>
    </ul>

          <td>Paweł Mogila</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <ul>
      <li>Godot has support for simplex noise and you can generate procedural 2D or even 3D noise with with various parameters. If we use and mix one or more of such noises in proper way you can get nice looking maps. All that happens on the CPU. In my talk I would like to show another approach which uses the GPU for making 2D maps. It’s much faster and we can instantly see the effects as we modify the shader. That gives us much faster iterations and more possibilities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <table>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <ul>
      <li>Through the nature of Imperative Programming coupled with Object Oriented Programming countless solutions for solving a problem emerge. This flexibility comes with a cost: beginners struggle with knowing where to start while advanced users seek out coding patterns for simplifying their projects, picking the helpful path not necessarily being an easy task. The GDQuest Coding Guidelines have emerged as a “standardized coding layout system” to improve code readability and project workflow by providing a way to think about code structure and object coupling in Godot.</li>

        </tr>
      </tbody>

    <ul>
      <li>This talk will teach the foundations of music composition and will show a workflow by which anyone can create his own instrumental tracks combining that knowledge with the aid of certain software. That’s the exact same workflow the speaker used to create the music for his upcoming game.</li>

        </tr>
      </tbody>

    <ul>
      <li>Ever wanted to become a Godot contributor, but don’t know where to start? This little guide will show how to identify the cause for a simple issue and make a Pull Request (PR) fixing it, following Godot’s contribution workflow.</li>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <ul>
      <li>Economic models are difficult to understand for ordinary people. I talk about how Godot can be used for more intuitive and understandable economic models especially through combining a certain school of economics (Austrian economics) and a certain kind of simulation (agent-based modelling). I consider how Godot’s unique scene-node system, flexible graphics, scripting language, and open source code make it a promising alternative to standard agent-based modelling software.</li>

      </tbody>
    </table>
    <ul>
      <li>A software design pattern is a repeatable solution that can be useful in many different scenarios. In this talk, I want to share with you how after developing several games in our studio using Godot, we have started improving our software design practices by implementing design patterns that make coding easier for us while making our games easier to maintain.</li>

    Răzvan Cosmin Rădulescu (Romania) is a programming freelancer working at <a href="https://www.gdquest.com/">GDQuest</a> on creating tools &amp; plugins for <abbr title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</abbr>. He's also the lead developer on GDQuest's latest 2D platformer game demo. Holds a masters in physics, but slowly drifted away from academia being drawn more by the idea of game development. He also has a keen interest in digital painting &amp; drawing and generally tech-related craft. His latest big dream is to create a highly dynamic community in his (small) home town in Romania, centered around the FOSS philosophy stretching across domains, not just tech.
