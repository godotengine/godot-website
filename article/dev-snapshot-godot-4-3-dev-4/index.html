				<p>4.3 dev 4 is jam-packed with changes after 3 weeks of further development. This is an unusually large dev release containing many bug fixes, stability improvements, and new features.</p>

<p>This release includes many notable changes including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AnimationMixer feature parity and other animation goodies.</li>
  <li>.NET code quality and usability improvements.</li>
  <li>Fixes for invalid/corrupt scenes.</li>
  <li>UFBX as a built-in alternative to FBX2glTF.</li>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>This snapshot comes loaded with new features and important fixes, after three weeks of further development.</p>

<p>As a reminder, this section only covers changes made since the previous <a href="/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-3-dev-3/">4.3 dev 3 snapshot</a>. For a more comprehensive overview of what’s new in Godot 4.3 compared to 4.2, you’ll have to wait for the first beta release, or refer to our <a href="https://godotengine.github.io/godot-interactive-changelog/#4.3">interactive changelog</a>.</p>

<h3 id="animationmixer-feature-parity-and-other-animation-goodies">AnimationMixer feature parity and other animation goodies</h3>

<p>AnimationMixer continues to receive several fixes and enhancements after being introduced in 4.2 to bring it up to parity with AnimationPlayer.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/86629">GH-86629</a> adds a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CallbackModeDiscrete</code> option to AnimationMixer to significantly improve the behavior when blending continuous and discrete tracks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/86661">GH-86661</a> introduces several fixes to how audio is handled by AnimationPlayers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/86715">GH-86715</a> expands the AnimationMixer and AnimationPlayer APIs with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AnimationMixer::capture()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AnimationPlayer::play_with_capture()</code> which can substitute the old capture update mode. The capture update mode has been difficult to use and prone to issues for a while now. The introduction of AnimationMixer highlighted many of those issues. The new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">capture()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">play_with_capture()</code> functions allow you to do the same things as before in a way that is much more aligned with Godot’s API and should work much better in general.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/87250">GH-87250</a> adds support for selecting, copying, pasting, and duplicating keyframes within the AnimationPlayer.</p>

<h3 id="net-code-quality-and-usability-improvements">.NET code quality and usability improvements</h3>

<p>C# received several fixes and usability improvements in this development release. Among them are <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/87890">GH-87890</a> which improves the handling of C# generic types. With this base scripts are shown in the “Add Node” and “Create Resource” dialogs even when they are generic types. Between <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/88469">GH-88469</a> and <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/88570">GH-88570</a> there has been a lot of cleanup of diagnostic rules and warnings resulting in a much smoother experience.</p>

<p>As a temporary workaround, we have disabled the ability to generate a signal callback in C# from the editor (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/87952">GH-87952</a>). This feature has long been broken for C# and has led to a lot of confusion. We will re-enable this once we have it working reliably (including for external editors).</p>

<h3 id="fixes-for-invalidcorrupt-scenes">Fixes for invalid/corrupt scenes</h3>

<p>A common complaint among users is that they get locked out of editing a scene because it contained an instance of a different scene that no longer exists (due to being renamed or deleted). Users learned to dread the well-known “Scene invalid/corrupt” error that resulted from this. <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/86781">GH-86781</a> aims to improve the situation by allowing you to open, edit, and fix scenes that have been corrupted due to a missing dependency. This should make the process of refactoring your projects within Godot feel quite a bit safer.</p>

<p>Another bugfix on the GDScript side may also help solve situations where using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">preload()</code> with cyclic dependencies leads to scenes being flagged as invalid (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85501">GH-85501</a>).</p>

<h3 id="add-ufbx-for-importing-fbx-files-without-fbx2gltf">Add UFBX for importing FBX files without FBX2glTF</h3>

<p>This monumental effort incorporates the popular UFBX library into Godot to allow for seamlessly importing FBX files (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/81746">GH-81746</a>). Previously users would have to download the FBX2glTF tool separately and Godot would invoke it to convert FBX files to glTF files in order to import them. UFBX allows us to avoid this process and import FBX files directly. This is a huge change and the FBX file format is notoriously difficult to work with, so please test this carefully and report any bugs you find.</p>

<h3 id="huge-improvement-to-pixel-stability-for-pixel-art-games">Huge improvement to pixel stability for pixel art games</h3>

<p>After much community discussion and the hard work of several contributors, we have merged a PR (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/87297">GH-87297</a>) that we think resolves many of the outstanding issues with pixel stability when making pixel art games. As before, it relies on using the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_projectsettings.html#class-projectsettings-property-rendering-2d-snap-snap-2d-transforms-to-pixel"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel</code></a> project setting. If you are making a pixel art game, please test this new release carefully and let us know how it goes.</p>

<h3 id="rendering-features-and-enhancements">Rendering features and enhancements</h3>

<p>A number of notable rendering changes have been merged recently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You can now specify a custom AABB for MultiMesh and CPUParticles3D which will allow Godot to skip generating one and save precious time (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/79833">GH-79833</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new shader built in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MAIN_CAM_INV_VIEW_MATRIX</code> provides a matrix that can be used to do billboarding calculations in a way where your mesh always faces the active camera (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72638">GH-72638</a>). This resolves a longstanding issue with shadows and billboarded sprites.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new CompositorEffects API has been added which lets you register callback functions that will be run in between rendering passes allowing you to insert rendering commands in the middle of Godot’s built in rendering pipeline (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/80214">GH-80214</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An option to use depth-based fog instead of the current exponential fog has been added (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/84792">GH-84792</a>). This closely aligns with the fog API from Godot 3.x.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support for Glow has been added to the compatibility backend (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/87360">GH-87360</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support for custom attributes is coming to 2D meshes (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/86564">GH-86564</a>). Custom attributes allow users to pass additional per-vertex data of their choosing to 2D meshes to create advanced effects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have refactored the RenderingDevice context management to further resolve stability issues in the Vulkan backend (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/87340">GH-87340</a>). A side-effect of this refactoring is that RenderingDevice contexts can be created anytime, even when the main window is not using a RenderingDevice context. This allowed us to quickly add baking of lightmaps when using the compatibility renderer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to new features and enhancements, contributors worked hard to improve Godot stability on older devices (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/87352">GH-87352</a>, <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/88573">GH-88573</a>).</p>

<h3 id="redesigned-graph-editor-for-visual-shaders">Redesigned graph editor for Visual Shaders</h3>

<p>The graph editor for Visual Shaders has been massively overhauled to significantly improve the UI and performance (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85017">GH-85017</a>). This change refreshes the design of the nodes to distinguish them more from each other and make them easier to read. It also adds unique colors per node category to make it easier to see what operations are being done at a glance and changes the colors of the connection types. Of course, these colors can be tweaked in the editor settings if you want. All of this is backwards compatible with existing Visual Shaders, so please enjoy!</p>

<h3 id="and-more">And more!</h3>

<ul>
  <li>GDExtension: Allow registering GDExtension (and C++ module) classes as “runtime” classes (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/82554">GH-82554</a>, <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/88683">GH-88683</a>).</li>
  <li>GDExtension: Allow GDExtensions to register virtual methods and call them on scripts (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/87758">GH-87758</a>).</li>
  <li>GDScript: Reintroduce binary tokenization on export (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/87634">GH-87634</a>).</li>
  <li>GUI: Rework the auto translation system (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/87530">GH-87530</a>).</li>
  <li>Web: Add PWA option to ensure cross-origin isolation headers on web export (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/86089">GH-86089</a>).</li>
  <li>WebXR: Add support for hand tracking (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/88411">GH-88411</a>).</li>
  <li>XR: Add face and body tracking support (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/88312">GH-88312</a>, <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/88798">GH-88798</a>).</li>
</ul>
