  prereleaseNotice:
    contentText:
      While engine maintainers try their best to ensure that each preview snapshot and release candidate is stable,
      this is by definition <strong>a pre-release piece of software</strong>. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a
      version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in a case of corruption or data loss.
