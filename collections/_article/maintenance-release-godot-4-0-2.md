The development of Godot 4.1 is starting to pick up steam — after a long, productive, but also exhausting month of March. Godot has received a lot of attention and love during [the GDC and the meetup at GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdAwlI6NG0I), and it's time to put all that feedback to good use. We will soon resume our regular preview releases that you have learned to enjoy during the later stages of the Godot 4.0 development.

In the meantime, Godot contributors have spent this month working on fixes and improvements for existing 4.0 users to enjoy and benefit from. Two weeks ago we have released 4.0.1, and it's time for the second patch release of the bunch — 4.0.2! Our focus is still on the more critical issues and smaller usability improvements that are safe to publish right now. 4.0.1 has also introduced a couple of unfortunate issues for macOS and Windows users, which are now addressed as well.

In this release we also aim to improve the experience of Android developers. This includes bumping the target Android SDK version to 33. If you are using third-party libraries and plugins with your projects, this may enable some configuration options and checks in them, which were ignored in previous versions.
