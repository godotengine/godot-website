**Update: Watch the GodotCon Livestream [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2c_kL23yI8).**

[As announced a few weeks back](https://godotengine.org/article/meet-community-godotcon-poznan-2018), we're organizing a [Godot Convention](https://godotengine.org/events) (**GodotCon**) in Poznań, Poland, on **10 & 11 October 2018**.

The organizers of the [Game Industry Conference](https://gic.gd/boards-committees/) (which is also in Poznań just after GodotCon) are letting us use their great venue, and it will be a great opportunity to get together with Godot users and core developers (our lead dev Juan Linietsky is coming from Argentina).

If by any chance you're close to Poznań and free next week, you can still register! It's free, you just have to [fill this form](https://framaforms.org/registration-godotcon-poznan-2018-1535467892) to let us know. See the [events page](https://godotengine.org/events) for more details.

## Talks, workshops and speakers

The schedule is not 100% final yet, but here's an overview of the talks/workshops that we planned so far, and some information on the speakers. The order shown below is only indicative, the exact time for each activity will be given Wednesday morning.

As mentioned on the [events page](https://godotengine.org/events), we plan two different focuses for the first and second day. The first day will focus more on engine contributions and technical discussions around the roadmap and future features, while the second day will be more general purpose with different talks and workshop to share game-making knowledge. Everyone is invited to attend both days though, we'll have activities proposed to match all interests.

### Wednesday, 10 October 2018

- **Talk:** *The many ways to contribute to Godot* | Rémi Verschelde ([Akien](https://github.com/akien-mga))
  * Godot relies on its community to evolve, and there are many ways for everyone to contribute depending on their skills and interests.
- **Demo:** *A short guide to contributing to Godot's editor* | Gilles Roudière ([groud](https://github.com/groud))
  * Godot's code base is big, but well organized. Gilles will show how to dive in the `editor/` folder to make changes to the editor without impacting the core engine.
- **Workshop:** *Hacktoberfest workshop - come and fix Godot!* | All core devs as tutors
  * Bring your computer and work on fixing engine issues or writing documentation under the guidance of core Godot devs.
  * Prerequisites: Laptop with Git, and for code contributions a C++ compiler installed.
- **Talk:** *New networking features and Multiplayer API in Godot 3.1* | Fabio Alessandrelli ([Fales](https://github.com/faless))
   * The next release comes with many new networking and multiplayer features, both high level APIs and support of protocols like WebSocket, WebRTC and UPNP.
- **Talk:** *But where are your scenes?* | Wojciech Chojnacki ([czlowiekimadlo](https://github.com/czlowiekimadlo))
  * A presentation/discussion about the approach to the code and assets structure, and how it works for your team depending on the composition and experience of said team.
- **Workshop:** *2D game workshop/demo* | Leszek Nowak ([John Meadow](https://github.com/JohnMeadow1))
  * Leszek will demo the development of a 2D game with audience interaction. Several options will be available based on attendees' interests: platformer shooter, space shooter with enemy AI, drift racing game, and pong with a twist - destructive environment.
- **Dev discussions** around current topics, everyone welcome to chime in and see how <abbr title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</abbr> gets made:
  * Roadmap for future Godot versions: 3.2 / 4.0
  * Upcoming changes for the networking API | Fabio Alessandrelli ([Fales](https://github.com/faless))
  * Potentially other topics based on needs/interests

The above activities are intentionally planned not to fill the whole day, so that there is time to get to know each other, present one's work to other attendees, playtest games, etc.
We'll shape the day based on the interests of the audience to make the most out of it :)

### Thursday, 11 October 2018

- **Demo:** *Showcase and insights into the new TPS demo* | Juan Linietsky ([reduz](https://github.com/reduz))

  * A quick set of patterns, tricks and rules that I like to keep in mind when I'm developing a game in Godot Engine.
- **Talk:** *Nonconventional games: Godot in medical simulation* | Ilaria Cislaghi ([QbieShay](https://github.com/QbieShay))
  * Godot is a powerful multipurpose engine that can be used for pushing the boundaries of medical simulation. In this presentation we will explore non-conventional use of the engine, software practices that emerged during development and thoughts about Godot itself.
- **Talk:** *Procrastinators hate him - a simple trick to keep development momentum* | Mariusz Chwalba ([koder](https://github.com/lekoder))

  * Jagiellonian University is deploying Godot as main teaching software for Geometry and Simulation. Leszek will present their project and how the Godot community can benefit from it.
