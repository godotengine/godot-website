*Edit:* Release Candidate 2 is now up.

A long time in the baking, but the first release candidate is here. This does not mean Godot is now without bugs, but that nothing should be too serious to affect your productivity. After stable release, we’ll keep fixing issues and then head over to 1.1 (see [roadmap](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/wiki/devel_roadmap)!).

If nothing too serious is found in this build this week, it will become 1.0 stable, so make sure to test well with your projects!
