We entered the [Release Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate) stage in the Godot 4.3 development cycle a week ago with [4.3 RC 1](/article/release-candidate-godot-4-3-rc-2), which means that all features are in place, the most critical regressions have been tackled, and we're confident that it's now ready for general use in the vast majority of cases.

A lot of users have been testing the RC 1 snapshot, reporting issues, many of which could be fixed. In the meantime, we've kept working on a few known bugs which we were still hoping to resolve for 4.3 - and by now most have been fixed!

Godot is a big piece of software and it's hard for contributors and even unit tests to validate all areas of the engine when developing new features or bug fixes. So we rely on extensive testing from the community to find engine issues while testing dev, beta, and RC snapshots in your projects, and reporting them so that we can fix them prior to tagging the 4.3-stable release.

Please, consider [supporting the project financially](https://fund.godotengine.org), if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors. Your donations go towards sponsoring their work and ensuring they can dedicate their undivided attention to the needs of the project.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also [try the **Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.3.rc2/) or the **Android editor** for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join [our testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds.

## Highlights

We covered the most important highlights from Godot 4.3 in the previous [4.3 beta 1 blog post](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-3-beta-1/), so if you haven't read that one, have a look to be introduced to the main new features added in the 4.3 release.

Especially if you're testing 4.3 for the first time, you'll want to get a condensed overview of what new features you might want to make use of.

This section covers changes made since the previous [RC 1 snapshot](/article/release-candidate-godot-4-3-rc-1/), which are mostly regression fixes, or "safe" fixes to longstanding issues.

## Known issues

During the Release Candidate stage, we focus exclusively on solving showstopping regressions (i.e. something that worked in a previous release is now broken, without workaround). You can have a look at our current [list of regressions and significant issues](https://github.com/orgs/godotengine/projects/61) which we aim to address before releasing 4.3. This list is dynamic and will be updated if we discover new blocking issues after more users start testing the RC snapshots.

With every release, we are aware that there are going to be various issues which have already been reported but haven't been fixed yet, due to limited resources. See the GitHub issue tracker for a complete list of [known bugs](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+).

## Bug reports

As a tester, we encourage you to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in this snapshot).

## Support
