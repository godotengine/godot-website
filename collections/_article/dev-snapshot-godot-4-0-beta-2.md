We released [Godot 4.0 beta 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-1) two weeks ago! That was a big milestone on our journey to finalize our next major release – be sure to check out that blog post if you haven't yet, for an overview of some of the main highlight of Godot 4.0.

But the "1" in beta 1 means that it's only the first step of the journey, and like for the alpha phase, we're going to release new beta snapshots roughly every other week. So here's beta 2!

The reception of beta 1 was surprisingly good – we're happy to see the community tinker with the beta, report bugs and provide feedback on the new features. Many bugs have been fixed in just two weeks, with close to [250 PRs merged](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2022-09-15..2022-09-29+milestone%3A4.0+is%3Amerged+), many of which fixed bugs reported by beta testers.

## Major changes

This beta 2 is not only bugfixes though! There were a few very important features that we didn't manage to review in time for beta 1, and which have now been implemented in beta 2.

### Exporting custom resources

Most notably a much improved support for exporting user-defined custom resources ([GH-62411](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/62411)), which used to be our [#1 most requested feature](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/18)!

You can now export your custom resources (named with `class_name`) using `@export var some_res: MyCustomRes`, and the Inspector will let you create and load instances of that resource type easily. There's still more work needed to integrate this properly in e.g. the Quick Load menu, for which we need to solve performance issues with the parsing of global classes.

This is all thanks to Will Nations ([willnationsdev](https://github.com/willnationsdev)) whom we can't thank enough for his dedication and perseverance with this feature. It's been in the pipeline for a long time and went through multiple iterations until we finally merged the current one. And there's more work pending to improve the underlying core components to make things more performant and easier to integrate in various parts of the editor and plugins.

### File/Directory wrappers replaced by FileAccess/DirAccess

Thanks to the combined work of Tomasz Chabora ([KoBeWi](https://github.com/KoBeWi)) and Pāvels Nadtočajevs ([bruvzg](https://github.com/bruvzg)), we could replace the `File` and `Directory` wrappers that we had to use to expose underlying `FileAccess` and `DirAccess` APIs, which are the ones Godot uses internally ([GH-65271](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/65271)). `FileAccess` and `DirAccess` were made reference counted, and given a lot of convenient static methods.

Check the `FileAccess` and `DirAccess` documentation in the editor for details, but to get you started, you should replace this kind of code:

```gdscript
var file = File.new()
if not file.file_exists("user://save_game.dat"):
    file.open("user://save_game.dat", File.WRITE)
    file.store_var(user_data)
    file.close()
```

With this, using the new static method and class name:
```gdscript
if not FileAccess.file_exists("user://save_game.dat"):
    var file = FileAccess.open("user://save_game.dat", FileAccess.WRITE)
    file.store_var(user_data)
    # No need for close(), `file` is reference counted and will be closed when going out of scope.
```

### XR improvements all around

Contributors in the XR area have been busy, and a lot of their work got merged these past two weeks!

While XR maintainer Bastiaan Olij ([BastiaanOlij](https://github.com/BastiaanOlij)) was busy finalizing OpenXR hand tracking ([GH-60313](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/60313)) and palm pose extension support ([GH-66282](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/66282)), other contributors have been working magic:
- Gergely Kis ([kisg](https://github.com/kisg)) and [korompg](https://github.com/korompg) implemented support for dynamically loading the OpenXR loader on Android ([GH-65798](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/65798)). This makes it possible to load the Meta Quest OpenXR loader on Meta devices.
- David Snopek ([dsnopek](https://github.com/dsnopek)) got WebXR minimally working again ([GH-64514](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/64514)) using the WebGL 2 renderer implemented by Clay John ([clayjohn](https://github.com/clayjohn)).
- [konczg](https://github.com/konczg) implemented the OpenXR passthrough extension wrapper ([GH-65898](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/65898)).

### And more!

And there's a lot more, but I'm running out of time to describe it and I want to release this beta today :P so please read on and check the PRs referenced below for details.

One thing worth noting though: With the beta phase, we're mostly done with feature implementation and we're doing our best to preserve compatibility so that beta users can easily move to future betas and stable builds. That being said, there are still occasions where changing an API before committing to it for the whole 4.x lifetime is worth it (e.g. the File/FileAccess change above), so some minor porting from beta to beta might still be needed.

We're trying to be reasonable with it and it shouldn't take more than a few minutes each time, if and when there are compat breaking changes. We're going to carefully apply the `breaks compat` label to PRs which do break compatibility from now on, so you can always review that list to see if any change impacts your projects. Here's the list of [`breaks compat` changes made between beta 1 and beta 2](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2022-09-15..2022-09-28+is%3Amerged+milestone%3A4.0+label%3A%22breaks+compat%22).

## Downloads

The downloads for this dev snapshot can be found directly on our repository:

* [Standard build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.0/beta2/) (GDScript, GDExtension).
* [.NET 6 build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.0/beta2/mono) (C#, GDScript, GDExtension).
  - Requires [.NET SDK 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) installed in a standard location.

## Known issues

As we are still in the early beta phase of development, there are still many issues to fix, some of which have already been reported and are being worked on. See the GitHub issue tracker for a list of [known bugs in the 4.0 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.0+label%3Abug+).

Some noteworthy issues you might run into in this beta 2:

- Exporting a Web build fails on Windows due to some file locking issue ([GH-65660](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/65660)).
  * See the issue for a potential workaround.
- Following [GH-65541](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/65541), the `rendering/renderer/rendering_method.mobile` project setting wrongly defaults to `forward_plus`, which means using the high-end forward+ rendering method on mobile. Change it to `mobile` if you want to export projects to Android or iOS.
- LightmapGI and VoxelGI are reported to be broken in this beta ([GH-66618](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/66618), [GH-66639](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/66639)).
