Godot will be at the [Libre Software Meeting 2018](https://2018.rmll.info/en) (also known as RMLL – *Rencontres Mondiales du Logiciel Libre*) in Strasbourg, France from **Saturday 7 July** to **Thursday 12 July**. We will give a 1-hour talk, a 3-hour game development workshop, and there will be a Godot stand with core developers to welcome you for the whole duration of the event.

[LSM](https://2018.rmll.info/en) is a yearly community event in France focused on Free/Libre and Open Source Software, and we're looking forward to representing Godot there this year. At least three core developers will be there (Julian Murgia ([StraToN](https://github.com/StraToN)), Gilles Roudière ([Groud](https://github.com/Groud)), and myself ([Akien](https://github.com/akien-mga))), and we hope that some more as well as many Godot users will join us in Strasbourg. The location should make it relatively accessible for people from neighbouring regions of France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg.

## Godot-related activities

We have three Godot-related offers for visitors of the LSM. Note that they are all located in different buildings of the LSM venue, see the [venue map](https://2018.rmll.info/en/info/map) as well as each activity's page for details.

- **Godot stand** in the [Libre Village](https://2018.rmll.info/en/program/calendar/list#saturday-village) during the whole event. We'll be there showcasing Godot, games made with it, and selling the awesome T-shirts designed by Daniel Ramirez ([djrm](https://github.com/djrm)) :) If you're coming to LSM, please come to our stand and say hi. You'll also be welcome to give us a hand manning the booth and talking about Godot to visitors :)

We may plan a Godot dinner and/or a real-life meeting if we have many community members around, so you can send me your contact details (email in the poll description) if you want to be in the loop.
