[Godot 3.3 was released a month ago](/article/godot-3-3-has-arrived), and we had a first maintenance release [last week with Godot 3.3.1](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-3-1). A few regressions made their way among the many bug fixes of 3.3.1, so here's another maintenance release to fix them.

Notably, Windows users could experience crashes when baking lightmaps. Games exported with a ZIP data package could also trigger a crash on exit. Additionally, this release includes a number of non-regression bug fixes to various areas of the engine.

Godot 3.3.2, [like all future 3.3.x releases](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.3/about/release_policy.html), focuses purely on bug fixes, and aims to preserve compatibility. It is a recommended upgrade for all Godot 3.3 users.

## Changes

See the [**curated changelog**](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/3.3.2-stable/CHANGELOG.md), or the full [commit history on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/compare/3.3.1-stable...3.3.2-stable) for an exhaustive overview of the fixes in this release.

If you're upgrading from Godot 3.3-stable, you may want to also read the more consequent changes included in [last week's 3.3.1 release](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-3-1).

Here are the the main changes since 3.3.1-stable:

- Android: Remove `-fno-integrated-as`, it can break arm64v8 build ([GH-48851](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48851)).
- Editor: Fix swapped front/rear directions in viewport rotation control ([GH-48895](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48895)).
- Editor: Fix editor crash when exporting profiler data ([GH-48917](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48917)).
- File: Fix duplicate close file when deconstructing ZipArchive ([GH-49013](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/49013)).
  * This would trigger a crash in Godot 3.3.1 when [exiting a project running from a ZIP data pack](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/49012).
- GDScript: Allow `warning-ignore` in the same line as the respective warning ([GH-47863](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/47863)).
- Geometry: Fix STL to Godot type conversion of polypartition ([GH-48921](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48921)).
- HTML5: Fix GDNative build with Emscripten 2.0.19+ ([GH-48831](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48831)).
- Import: Print a warning when importing a repeating NPOT texture in a GLES2 project ([GH-48817](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48817)).
- Import: glTF: Improved error handling around invalid images and invalid meshes ([GH-48904](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48904), [GH-48912](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48912)).
- Import: glTF: Fix incorrect skin deduplication when using named binds ([GH-48913](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48913)).
- macOS: Allow "on top" windows to enter full-screen mode ([GH-49017](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/49017)).
- Physics: Fix ragdoll simulation when parent was readded to scene ([GH-48823](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48823)).
- Physics: Fix crash on debug shapes update if CollisionObject is not in tree ([GH-48974](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48974)).
- Rendering: Batching: Fix `item_batch_flags` stale state causing glitches ([GH-48992](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48992)).
- Sky: Remove high radiance sizes from the editor due to issues on specific GPUs ([GH-48906](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48906)).
- Windows: Fix Embree crash when building with MinGW ([GH-48888](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48888)).
  * Official builds are made with MinGW, and Godot 3.3.1 was thus subject to this [crash when baking lightmaps](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/48822).
- API documentation updates.
