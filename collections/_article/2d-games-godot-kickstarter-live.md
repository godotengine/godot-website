## Learn to create your own 2d game inspired by Zelda! 

GDquest is on Kickstarter again, and we're doing this in collaboration with the Godot developers. We want to bring you **the first professional course for our favourite Free and Open Source Game Engine!**

**For the next 30 days, get one free tutorial daily on YouTube!**

Update: the Kickstarter was funded in 12 hours! There are [plenty of stretch goals](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gdquest/make-professional-2d-games-godot-engine-online-cou/posts/1893587) to unlock, including direct contributions to the Godot 3.0 documentation.

All the money will go to make the course: the higher the funding, the bigger your reward.

**Back the project now and get at least 50% off the course’s price:**
