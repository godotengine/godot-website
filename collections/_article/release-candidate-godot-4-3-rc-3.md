Third time's the charm! A few more regressions have been found and fixed thanks to our previous two [Release Candidates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate) for Godot 4.3, so we are now going for a third round to validate those last minute fixes.

All issues and PRs which were still on the 4.3 milestone but not critical have now been retriaged and postponed, which means the release should be good to go! Of course we haven't fixed all known bugs in the engine, but we believe we've addressed the ones that could prevent users from having a better experience in 4.3 than in the current 4.2 stable branch.

Godot is a big piece of software and it's hard for contributors and even unit tests to validate all areas of the engine when developing new features or bug fixes. So we rely on extensive testing from the community to find engine issues while testing dev, beta, and RC snapshots in your projects, and reporting them so that we can fix them prior to tagging the 4.3-stable release.

Please, consider [supporting the project financially](https://fund.godotengine.org), if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors. Your donations go towards sponsoring their work and ensuring they can dedicate their undivided attention to the needs of the project.

## Highlights

We covered the most important highlights from Godot 4.3 in the previous [4.3 beta 1 blog post](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-3-beta-1/), so if you haven't read that one, have a look to be introduced to the main new features added in the 4.3 release.

Especially if you're testing 4.3 for the first time, you'll want to get a condensed overview of what new features you might want to make use of.

This section covers changes made since the previous [RC 2 snapshot](/article/release-candidate-godot-4-3-rc-2/), which are mostly regression fixes, or "safe" fixes to longstanding issues.

## Known issues

During the Release Candidate stage, we focus exclusively on solving showstopping regressions (i.e. something that worked in a previous release is now broken, without workaround). You can have a look at our current [list of regressions and significant issues](https://github.com/orgs/godotengine/projects/61) which we aim to address before releasing 4.3. This list is dynamic and will be updated if we discover new blocking issues after more users start testing the RC snapshots.

With every release, we are aware that there are going to be various issues which have already been reported but haven't been fixed yet, due to limited resources. See the GitHub issue tracker for a complete list of [known bugs](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+).

## Bug reports

As a tester, we encourage you to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in this snapshot).
