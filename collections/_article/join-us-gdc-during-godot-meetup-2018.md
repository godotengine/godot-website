Will you be attending GDC? If so, please come visit us at our 2018 meetup that we organize together with GitHub.

If you are a Godot user, this will be a great chance to meet other Godot users and developers.

If you are only interested about Godot (and you should!), this will be the best chance to find out more about the project during GDC.

The event requires previous registration, so please [register here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/godot-meetup-at-gdc-tickets-43720910420).

Will be seeing you there!
