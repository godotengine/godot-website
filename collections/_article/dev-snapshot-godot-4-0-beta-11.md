With the end-of-the-year celebrations past us, we are ready to get back to work and continue our regular Godot 4.0 beta releases. Over the course of the last [four months](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-1) the engine has seen many changes, making it more stable and feature complete, and it's getting very close to the state that we would be [happy with](/article/release-management-4-0-and-beyond).

We took a bit longer to prepare this beta as there were a number of fairly big GDScript refactoring PRs (needed to fix many bugs), which we wanted to merge all at once. As such we expect that this beta 11 might introduce some new GDScript regressions, which we'll aim to fix for beta 12 next week. Be sure to report anything that stops working as expected in your scripts.

This beta includes a few big changes which may interest a lot of users:

- Animated sprites, both 2D and 3D, now support options for more precise timing of individual frames ([GH-65609](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/65609)).
- More engine enums are now bound with BitField, making their usage more type-safe, especially in C# ([GH-71037](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71037), [GH-71045](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71045), [GH-71116](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71116)).
- Many improvements, fixes, and optimizations have been done to GDScript and its runtime environment ([GH-62688](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/62688), [GH-64253](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/64253), [GH-69590](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/69590), [GH-69991](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/69991),  [GH-70246](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70246), [GH-70464](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70464), [GH-70613](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70613), [GH-70655](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70655), [GH-70658](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70658), [GH-70702](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70702),  [GH-70838](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70838), [GH-70859](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70859),  [GH-71051](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71051), [GH-71107](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71107), and more).
- Our copyright statement has been updated to be ever-green, and to put the bulk of our beloved contributors on the first line; it's completely compatible with the previous version otherwise ([GH-70885](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70885)).

## What's new

If you're interested in an overview of what's new in Godot 4.0 beta in general, have a look at the detailed release notes for [4.0 beta 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-1). In this blog post, we will only cover the main changes since the previous beta release.

See the [**changelog on GitHub**](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/compare/d0398f62f08ce0cfba80990b21c6af4181f93fe9...91713ced81792b10fdc9367b7f355738e5d52777), or the [**list of merged PRs**](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2022-12-23T20%3A00..2023-01-10T14%3A00+is%3Amerged+sort%3Acreated-asc+milestone%3A4.0), for an overview of all changes since 4.0 beta 10 (163 commits – excluding merge commits ― from 71 contributors).

While we do our best to minimize compatibility breaking changes for existing beta users, there are still occasional changes in the API which may impact your Godot 4 projects. See the list of PRs with the [`breaks compat` label](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2022-12-23T20%3A00..2023-01-10T14%3A00+is%3Amerged+sort%3Acreated-asc+milestone%3A4.0+label%3A%22breaks+compat%22) for details.

## Known issues

As we are still in the early beta phase of development, there are still many issues to fix, some of which have already been reported and are being worked on. See the GitHub issue tracker for a list of [known bugs in the 4.0 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.0+label%3Abug+).

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

As in any major release there are going to be compatibility breaking changes. However, we still try to provide a migration path for your projects. If you experience a regression without a known migration path or workaround, do not hesitate to report it.
