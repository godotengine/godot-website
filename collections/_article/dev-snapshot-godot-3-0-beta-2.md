**Edit 22.12.2017:** Windows binaries (both the editor binaries and the export templates) have been replaced by versions without OpenMP support, the latter forcing the installation of the MS Visual C++ Redistributable 2017 to get the OpenMP DLL. If you downloaded export templates before 22.12.2017 at 23:59 UTC, we advise to download them anew to get the proper portable Windows binaries.

Three weeks after our [3.0 beta 1 development snapshot](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-3-0-beta-1), it's time for another beta release to bring us closer to the final 3.0 version.

We initially hoped for a stable release around Christmas, but given that we're publishing 3.0 *beta 2* today, you can probably assume that 3.0 *stable* will be an early 2018 release instead. And that's just as well, since a lot of work continues to be done every day to fix issues in the master branch and improve usability, and Juan even took the time to sneak in a couple past-deadline but very requested features, like a [lightmapper](/article/introducing-new-last-minute-lightmapper) for static light baking (to provide an alternative to the real-time but resource-heavy GIProbe).

This release fixes many of the issues that you reported while testing *beta 1*, so it should be a lot more stable. There are definitely still bugs here and there, so please report anything you might stumble upon.

## Disclaimer

**IMPORTANT: This is a *[beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta)* build, which means that it is *not suitable* for use in production, nor for press reviews of what Godot 3.0 would be on its release.**

There will still be many fixes and enhancements done before the final release, and we will need your [detailed bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) to debug issues and fix them. Notably, the 3D performance varies greatly depending on your graphics hardware, and will be improved and streamlined progressively as Godot 3 stabilizes.

## Downloads

The download links are not featured on the [Download](/download) page for now to avoid confusing new users. Instead, browse one of our mirrors and download the editor binary for your platform and the export templates archive:

- Classical version: [[HTTPS mirror](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.0/beta2)] [[HTTP mirror](http://op.godotengine.org:81/downloads/3.0/beta2)]
- Mono version (requires the Mono SDK): [[HTTPS mirror](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.0/beta2/mono)] [[HTTP mirror](http://op.godotengine.org:81/downloads/3.0/beta2/mono)]

Note that Godot can now download and install the export templates automatically, so you don't need to download them manually. If you installed export templates for the previous 3.0 *beta 1* release, make sure to uninstall them/replace them by the *beta 2* ones, as they are not compatible. Export templates for the Mono flavour will not be provided for beta 2, as exporting Mono games is not fully implemented yet.

Also clone the [godot-demo-projects](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/) repository to have demos to play with. Some of them might still need adjustments due to recent changes in the *master* branch, feel free to report any issue.

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to open bug reports if you experience issues with beta 2. Please check first the [existing issues](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

Have fun with this beta 2 and stay tuned for a release candidate (RC) in the first weeks of January!
