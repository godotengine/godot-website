The core of the Godot development focus is on the upcoming Godot 4.2, currently with a [3rd dev snapshot](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-2-dev-3/). But we haven't forgotten about the 3.6 release, which has a slow but steady influx of important bug fixes, platform improvements, and rendering features. Godot 3 is still very important for a significant part of the ecosystem - notably people with released games, games close to being released, or who need to target OpenGL 2 / WebGL 1 to maximize device compatibility.

It's been a long time since the earlier 3.6 beta snapshots, so check the [beta 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-3-6-beta-1/) and [beta 2](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-3-6-beta-2/) announcements for details on what changed since 3.5.

A lot of work is also being done to improve the Android editor port. We're looking for interested users to help test the beta snapshots via Google Play, and provide us with feedback and automated reports on potential issues.

It was developed by [Lucas Molina](https://twitter.com/AD1337) with Godot 3.5, and just got released on [**Steam**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1895970/Robotherapy/)!*

## Highlights

Two new important features for 2D are introduced in this beta, courtesy of [lawnjelly](https://github.com/lawnjelly).

### 2D hierarchical culling

Previously, each 2D item was checked individually to see whether it was off screen and so not needing to be drawn (culling). With hierarchical culling, entire branches of the scene tree can be culled at once, which can significantly increase performance on large 2D maps that contain a lot of off screen items.

Hierarchical culling defaults to on, but can be switched back to the legacy ("Item") mode with the project setting `rendering/2d/options/culling_mode`, in case of regressions.

### 2D physics interpolation

Godot 3.5 introduced 3D physics interpolation with great success, and users have been awaiting its 2D counterpart, so here it comes! This initial version of 2D physics interpolation supports most objects, including `CPUParticles2D`, but is a work in progress that will depend on your feedback. Notably (GPU) `Particles2D` is not yet supported, but the initial version should be good for experimentation. There will be bugs and special cases for lawnjelly to fix, please report these on GitHub.

Some preliminary documentation can be found here: [2D FTI docs](https://github.com/lawnjelly/Misc/blob/master/FTIDocs/fti_2D.md). Note that physics interpolation is disabled by default, [refer to the docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.6/tutorials/physics/interpolation/index.html) for how to enable it.
