The development of Godot 4.1 is coming to the end of the [feature merging phase](/article/release-management-4-1/), and we expect to enter *feature freeze* very soon. That means that contributors are putting finishing touches on every enhancement that is going to make it into the final release, and so once again we need you to help us test these improvements.

This dev snapshot comes with a bouquet of fixes, optimizations, and usability tweaks. Among those there are several changes that can be of interest to many:

- We introduce an option to use model space for the `look_at` method, and other similar methods. It has been a long standing problem that by convention many models are sculpted facing the camera, which conflicts with Godot's coordinate system design. As a result, trying to use methods like `look_at` with such models causes them to face forward with their backs and not their fronts. To address that problem and other related issues the following changes have been made:
  - Add an option to use model space with `look_at` and similar ([GH-76082](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76082)).
  - Switch "front" and "back" camera views in the editor to be consistent with itself ([GH-76052](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76052)).
  - Fix a long-standing `PathFollow` issue with the forward direction ([GH-72842](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72842)).

- The frame delta smoothing feature, first introduced in Godot 3.4, has been finally ported to Godot 4 ([GH-52314](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/52314)).

- We continue to improve Godot's multi-threaded behavior and fix bugs from the recent changes. Such improvements include multiple fixes to multi-threaded resource loading ([GH-74405](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/74405), [GH-77143](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/77143)), multiple fixes to the `WorkerThreadPool` class ([GH-76945](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76945), [GH-76999](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76999)), and an early version of the multi-threaded node processing ([GH-75901](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/75901)). Thread safety of many engine and editor types has been improved, though this work is still ongoing and will continue into Godot 4.2.

- This release also includes one of the most anticipated editor usability features â€” the ability to detach script and shader editors into their own window ([GH-62378](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/62378)). Please give us your feedback on the look and feel of this new tool in your productivity belt!

- GDExtension contributors made many improvements and changes, including a rework of the GDExtension interface ([GH-76406](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76406)) and a new backwards compatibility system ([GH-76446](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76446)).

- The navigation avoidance system has been completely reworked ([GH-69988](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/69988)). This massive change affects both 2D and 3D navigation, and closes a good chunk of related issues and proposals. Check out the linked PR for a lot more details and demos.

- For the technical artists this release comes with a rework of the turbulence system for particles, making it easier to create impressive and beautiful dynamic effects ([GH-77154](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/77154)).

That's quite a lot for one dev release, isn't it? [Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about included changes.

We created a separate Play Store release for the Godot 4.1 dev snapshots, so that interested users can test it easily and provide us with feedback and automated reports on potential issues. [You can join the testing group here to get access.](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers)

*The illustration picture for this article is from* **Liminal Tower**, *an experimental project by [lowraiz](https://twitter.com/lowraiz) being developed in Godot 4. It has liminal spaces, portals, and it works in VR! You can follow lowraiz on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lowraiz) for more work-in-progress screenshots and clips, and other experiments.*

The downloads for this dev snapshot can be found directly on our repository:

* [Standard build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.1/dev3/) (GDScript, GDExtension).
* [.NET 6 build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.1/dev3/mono) (C#, GDScript, GDExtension).
  - Requires [.NET SDK 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) or [7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) installed in a standard location.

## Known issues

With every release we accept that there are going to be various issues, which have already been reported but haven't been fixed yet. See the GitHub issue tracker for a list of [known bugs in the 4.1 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.1+label%3Abug+). Of note:

- `ExtResource` IDs in existing scenes might change when using this build, causing some diffs for your version control. It's not clear yet whether it's an intentional, one off change to the id system, or a regression that would be fixed in a future build ([GH-77172](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/77172)).

- During the import process you may see a lot of the "Attempting to parent and popup a dialog that already has a parent" messages. This error has no effect on the importing process and should be fixed in the next build ([GH-77426](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/77426)).

## Bug reports

As a tester, we encourage you to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in 4.0.x, but no longer works in 4.1 dev 3).
