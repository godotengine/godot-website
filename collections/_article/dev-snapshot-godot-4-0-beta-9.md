Godot 4.0 has been in beta for [over three months](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-1), and the overall feature completeness, stability and usability have improved a lot during that time.

We continue to release a new snapshot every week to get fast feedback on our bugfixes, and potential regressions they may introduce. Thank you for your rigorous testing and timely reports!

This beta includes a few big changes which may interest a lot of users:

- `String` and `StringName` are now mostly cross-compatible throughout the engine API, as well as in various GDScript-specific expressions and statements ([GH-68747](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/68747)).
- GDScript now fully supports out of order member resolution ([GH-69471](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/69471)).
- Every supported renderer option is now selectable from the project creation screen, which means you can create OpenGL 3 ("Compatibility") projects without using the command line ([GH-70028](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70028)).
- The OpenGL renderer now use an instanced array buffer instead of UBO for canvas item batching, increasing performance and compatibility on low-end devices, including Intel Macs ([GH-70065](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70065)).

You can also [try the Web editor](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.0.beta9/godot.editor.html) (early testing, it's still slow and unstable).

## What's new

If you're interested in an overview of what's new in Godot 4.0 beta in general, have a look at the detailed release notes for [4.0 beta 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-1). In this blog post, we will only cover the main changes since the previous beta release.

See the [**changelog on GitHub**](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/compare/c6e40e1c01200052450df10d9126f8ea7f57de30...e780dc332a0a3f642a6daf8548cb211d79a2cc45), or the [**list of merged PRs**](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2022-12-09..2022-12-18+is%3Amerged+sort%3Acreated-asc+milestone%3A4.0), for an overview of all changes since 4.0 beta 8 (178 commits – excluding merge commits ― from 63 contributors).

While we do our best to minimize compatibility breaking changes for existing beta users, there are still occasional changes in the API which may impact your Godot 4 projects. See the list of PRs with the [`breaks compat` label](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2022-12-09..2022-12-18+is%3Amerged+sort%3Acreated-asc+milestone%3A4.0+label%3A%22breaks+compat%22) for details.

As in any major release there are going to be compatibility breaking changes. However, we still try to provide a migration path for your projects. If you experience a regression without a known migration path or workaround, do not hesitate to report it.
