The official GodotCon returns to Europe and this time, it will be the first GodotCon in the city where the Godot Foundation calls home. For this edition of the event, we teamed up with the [Dutch Games Association](https://dutchgamesassociation.nl/) to help us organize it and make sure that everything runs smoothly.

### Will there still be a Godot event in the US in 2026?
Absolutely! The same team behind the GodotCon Boston will be announcing more details about the event for 2026 in the US. It will come back with a different name, but everything else should be the same. 

See you soon!
