[Godot 3.2.3 was released a month ago](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-2-3) and the reception was great! It focused mostly on fixing bugs and therefore we were somewhat conservative on what could be merged before the release.

Now that we're confident that 3.2.3 works well, we can take some time to add new features to the `3.2` branch while you wait for Godot 4.0 :)

This first beta build already includes a number of them which have been worked on by core contributors, with notable mentions to:

- Android App Bundle and subview embedding support.
- 2D batching for GLES3 (remember that we added it for GLES2 in 3.2.2), and improvements to GLES2's batching.
- A new software skinning for MeshInstance to replace the slow GPU skinning on devices that don't support the fast GPU skinning (especially mobile).

And this is just a first beta, there's more in the works that will be included in future beta builds.

## Downloads

The download links for dev snapshots are not featured on the [Download](/download) page to avoid confusion for new users. Instead, browse our download repository and fetch the editor binary that matches your platform:

- [Mono build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2.4/beta1/mono/) (C# support + all the above). You need to have MSBuild installed to use the Mono build. Relevant parts of Mono 6.12.0.102 are included in this build.

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with 3.2.4 beta 1. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in 3.2.3 or earlier no longer works in 3.2.4 beta 1).
