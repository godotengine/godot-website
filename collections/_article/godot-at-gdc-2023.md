We are excited to announce that the Godot Engine will attend the 2023 [Game Developers Conference](https://gdconf.com/) (GDC), on March 20-24.

The Game Developer Conference is a yearly event in San Francisco, California. It is the world's largest professional game industry event, with over 26,000 attendees. The conference features over 700 lectures, panels, and workshops on a variety of game development topics, as well as a large expo floor with over 500 exhibitors.

Thanks to [W4 Games](https://w4games.com/) who are donating it, the Godot Engine will have its own booth for the first time. We got in touch and teamed up with a selection of Godot developers from all over the world to present their high-profile games at our booth, and share their Godot experience with visitors. This is an excellent opportunity if you want to meet the people behind the engine, or other like-minded folks, so come to hang out and play some of the fantastic games. You might even get some free swag ;)

We'll give more details in coming months as we get closer to the event, so stay tuned!
