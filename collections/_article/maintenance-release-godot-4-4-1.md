We released [Godot 4.4](/releases/4.4/) in early March and we are delighted to see the reception, with so many users upgrading to it on day one and sharing their favorite new changes on social media! If you haven't seen the [**4.4 release page**](/releases/4.4/), it's well worth a read!

Since then, we've started the development phase for Godot 4.5 at full speed (with a first [dev snapshot](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-5-dev-1/) released last week!), but we also put our main focus on fixing remaining and newly reported regressions that affect users who upgraded to 4.4. A few of these issues can be showstoppers for affected users, so we decided to release a 4.4.1 maintenance release as soon as possible.

See below for a list of the most relevant changes. This release includes fixes to [security vulnerabilities](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/releases/tag/mbedtls-3.6.3) in the mbedTLS third-party library, so we strongly recommend updating for any game using networking functionality.

Maintenance releases are expected to be safe for an upgrade, but we recommend to always make backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.

Please, consider [supporting the project financially](#support), if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors. Your donations go towards sponsoring their work and ensuring they can dedicate their undivided attention to the needs of the project.

## Known incompatibilities

As of now, there are no known incompatibilities with the previous Godot 4.4 release. **We encourage all users to upgrade to 4.4.1.**

If you experience any unexpected behavior change in your projects after upgrading to 4.4.1, please [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues).

## Bug reports

As a tester, we encourage you to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in this snapshot).
