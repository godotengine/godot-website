The release of Godot 4.1 was [just a couple of weeks ago](/article/godot-4-1-is-here) and we are ready for the first maintenance release — addressing some of the bugs and annoyances that have slipped into the stable build.

Deciding where to draw the line and mark a release as stable is a tricky thing. On the one hand, there are always unresolved issues. But on the other, not every issue is critical enough to block all other improvements and fixes from shipping. With our current [release management plan](/article/release-management-4-1/) we put the effort into reducing the number of changes the closer we are to the planned release date, as this ensures we don't get an unexpected breakage or regressions. Contributors, however, remain determined to improve Godot, so by the time the first maintenance release comes around, we have plenty of goodies to include!

Some of the most important changes in this release include:

- Fix for a crash due to an infinite loop in `AnimationStateMachine` ([GH-79141](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/79141)). It was a gnarly issue because it was easy to trigger with a bare minimum configuration. Now circular dependencies are correctly detected preventing infinite looping.

- Command-line export of C#/.NET projects should no longer drop random files ([GH-79173](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/79173)). Your exports may have had arbitrary resources missing (not C# scripts, but images, for instance), if you were exporting your project with CLI. This should no longer happen.

- Custom export options which you can define with an `EditorExportPlugin` are now correctly restored on the editor restart ([GH-79025](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/79025)). Previously the usability of this freshly added feature was limited due to data loss between sessions.

- For Linux users there is a potential fix for freezes when interacting with menus on Wayland ([GH-79143](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/79143)). This was a hard to identify and debug issue, but our local Wayland enthusiasts managed to pinpoint the likely cause and validate that the unwanted behavior was addressed.

The game is being made by [Firebelley](https://twitter.com/firebelley) with Godot 4 using its excellent C# language support, and is planned to be released later this year. But no need to wait, because you can play a demo on Steam [right now](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2258480/Gunforged/)!
