Another year, another GDC! This year, many of us core developers will be attending GDC in representation of the project to meet with companies interested in knowing more about Godot (or just meeting with us).

If you want to meet with us during GDC, please drop us a mail to *contact at godotengine Â· org* and we will attempt to schedule a meeting.

For Godot users, we will soon be announcing our very own Godot party during GDC!

See you there!
