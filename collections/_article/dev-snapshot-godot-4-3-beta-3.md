We are nearing the end of the beta phase for Godot 4.3, which received many fixes during the past 6 weeks thanks to the testing and bug reports of the community. It's shaping up to be a very solid release, solving a lot of pain points expressed by the userbase.

We've now solved most of the issues we considered blocking for the 4.3 release. [A few remain](https://github.com/orgs/godotengine/projects/61/views/1) but not all are actually critical, just regressions we'd like to solve before the stable release if possible. As such, we're pretty close to the Release Candidate stage, which will probably start next week.

Godot is a big piece of software and it's hard for contributors and even unit tests to validate all areas of the engine when developing new features or bug fixes. So we rely on extensive testing from the community to find engine issues while testing dev, beta, and RC snapshots in your projects, and reporting them so that we can fix them prior to tagging the 4.3-stable release.

Please, consider [supporting the project financially](#support), if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors. Your donations go towards sponsoring their work and ensuring they can dedicate their undivided attention to the needs of the project.
Notably, we're now looking to add [one or more generalist programmers](https://godot.foundation/jobs/senior-generalist-c++-programmer/) to the team, and the Godot Foundation needs to increase its [monthly funding](https://fund.godotengine.org/) to be able to sustain multiple long-term contractors.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also [try the **Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.3.beta3/) or the **Android editor** for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join [our testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds.

## Known issues

During the beta stage, we focus on solving both regressions (i.e. something that worked in a previous release is now broken) and significant new bugs introduced by new features. You can have a look at our current [list of regressions and significant issues](https://github.com/orgs/godotengine/projects/61) which we aim to address before releasing 4.3. This list is dynamic and will be updated if we discover new showstopping issues after more users start testing the beta snapshots.

With every release, we accept that there are going to be various issues which have already been reported but haven't been fixed yet. See the GitHub issue tracker for a complete list of [known bugs](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+).

## Bug reports

As a tester, we encourage you to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in this snapshot).

## Support

Godot is a non-profit, open source game engine developed by hundreds of contributors on their free time, as well as a handful of part or full-time developers hired thanks to [generous donations from the Godot community](https://fund.godotengine.org/). A big thank you to everyone who has contributed [their time](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/AUTHORS.md) or [their financial support](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/DONORS.md) to the project!

If you'd like to support the project financially and help us secure our future hires, you can do so using the [Godot Development Fund](https://fund.godotengine.org/) platform managed by [Godot Foundation](https://godot.foundation/). There are also several [alternative ways to donate](/donate) which you may find more suitable.
