We released [Godot 4.0 beta 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-1) in September, and that was a big milestone on our journey to finalize our next major release – be sure to check out that blog post if you haven't yet, for an overview of some of the main highlight of Godot 4.0.

Since then, we've been releasing new beta snapshots every other week, and this is now the 5th beta.
Some of the most notable changes in this update include:

- Editor: Add undo/redo history dock ([GH-65012](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/65012)).
- GDScript: Fix countless errors with inner class in GDScript compiler ([GH-68374](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/68374)).
- GUI: Implement SVG in OT support, enabling SVG emoji fonts ([GH-64530](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/64530)).
- Rendering: A ton of fixes for all rendering backends, and missing features implemented for the OpenGL3 one.
- Web: The [**Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.0.beta5/godot.editor.html) is now somewhat functional for the first time! It's fairly slow and there are still a lot of issues to iron out, but you should be able to start it, edit a project and run it. It is not yet usable in production.

The game is developed by Vedg Studio / [NoirosL](https://twitter.com/NoirosL/) and was recently ported to Godot 4.0 beta.

See the GitHub issue tracker for a list of [known bugs in the 4.0 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.0+label%3Abug+).

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

As in any major release there are going to be compatibility breaking changes. However, we still try to provide a migration path for your projects. If you experience a regression without a known migration path or workaround, do not hesitate to report it.
