We‚Äôre excited to announce a new annual, independent convention centered around Godot: **GodotFest**!

What does this mean? It means we‚Äôll now have another annual Godot event to look forward to! Godot*Con*, still organized
by the Godot Foundation, will continue to travel the world, offering a great starting point for anyone curious about
the engine.

Godot*Fest*, meanwhile, will be held in the same location each year, always around the same time of the year. Since it‚Äôs aimed more
at a professional audience, it‚Äôll take place during the workweek to make business travel more convenient.

While not quite the same as GodotCon, GodotFest is organized by the Munich Godot user group,
the same team behind the GodotCon 23. That's why it will take place in **Munich, Germany,
on the 11th and 12th of November, at Smartvillage Bogenhausen**.

Next year, you can expect to have at least three events: GodotCon North America, GodotCon Europe and GodotFest.
