We‚Äôre excited to announce a new annual, independent convention centered around Godot: **GodotFest**!

What does this mean? It means we‚Äôll now have another annual Godot event to look forward to! Godot*Con*, will still be organized
by the Godot Foundation in 2026, and it will continue to travel the world, offering a great starting point for anyone curious about
the engine.

Godot*Fest*, meanwhile, will be held in the same location each year, always around the same time of the year. Since it‚Äôs aimed more
at a professional audience, it‚Äôll take place during the workweek to make business travel more convenient.

This year, the GodotFest will be the GodotCon in Europe. Starting next year, you can expect to have at least three events: GodotCon North America, GodotCon Europe and GodotFest.

GodotFest is organized by the Munich Godot user group, the same team behind the GodotCon 23 - that's why it will take place in **Munich, Germany, on the 11th and 12th of November, at Smartvillage Bogenhausen**.

These two days will be filled with many talks and workshops vetted by our talented submission committee
and plenty of chances to meet new people. We strive to create a professional event in a beautiful,
light and modern venue with opportunities to:

- connect with others in the Godot ecosystem
- pitch your games and
- enjoy great food and drinks throughout the event (included in your ticket)
