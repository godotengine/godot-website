Hello Godotters!

As the days passes and the team and contributors work hard to deliver Godot 4.x and Godot 3.4, we want to shine a light on the amazing projects that are made using Godot.

Our project manager Rémi already collected all of them in a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/Akien/status/1444052705820004353). The list of games is reproduced below.

### The Steam Next Fest

Steam organizes a recurring event called the *[Steam Next Fest](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/steamnextfest/2021oct)*:

> Steam Next Fest is a multi-day celebration where fans can try out demos, chat with developers, watch livestreams, and learn about upcoming games on Steam. For developers, Steam Next Fest is an opportunity to get early feedback from players and build an audience for a future launch on Steam.

**You have until the 7th of October 2021 @ 17:00 UTC to test the games!**
