The upcoming Godot 3.4 release will provide a number of new features which have been backported from the 4.0 development branch (see our [release policy](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/release_policy.html) for details on the various Godot versions). With this first [Release Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate), we completely freezes feature development, and comes after a long series of beta builds to fix a number of bugs reported against previous builds (as well as against previous stable branches).

If you already reviewed the changelog for beta 6, you can skip right to the [differences between beta 6 and RC 1](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/compare/3e2bb415a9b186596b9ce02debc79590380c2355...90f8cd89a738316563dac9b133628df6bafe2cb2). Notable changes are in-editor class reference translations (so far Chinese (Simplified), Spanish, and some French), some new rendering features (high quality glow mode, 3D point light attenuation option), and a number of C# marshalling fixes.
