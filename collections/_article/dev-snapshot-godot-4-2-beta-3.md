We entered the beta phase for Godot 4.2 a couple of weeks ago, with [4.2 beta 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-2-beta-1/). If you missed that release, have a look at the [release notes](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-2-beta-1/) for an overview of the key changes in Godot 4.2.

Since the start of the beta phase, we fixed a number of bugs reported by the community, so we're publishing further beta snapshots to validate those fixes, and iterate closer to the release candidate stage.

Notably, this third beta improves support for 3D projects made with Godot 4.1 when migrating them to Godot 4.2. Following our changes to the [mesh vertices and attributes compression format](https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-2-beta-1/#rendering-particles-and-shaders), we are now introducing a helpful dialog when you first open a pre-existing project. It lets you choose to upgrade and re-save all the meshes in your projects to make them compatible with Godot 4.2.

This release also [updates the toolchains](https://github.com/godotengine/build-containers/pull/128) used to build official binaries, notably for Windows, macOS, iOS and JavaScript. This should be mostly transparent to end users, but toolchain bugs are a possibility. So please report if anything seems off compared to the previous beta build in terms of performance, or outright crashing.

For C# users, the .NET 8.0 release is set to be launched this November. Make sure to try the current preview release ([`8.0.0-rc.2`](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)) with Godot to make sure everything works as expected. This Godot beta release includes a fix to [support preview releases](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/83325) so give it a try and report any bugs that you find.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also [try the **Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.2.beta3/) or the **Android editor** for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join [our testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds.
