Godot 4.1 is shaping up to be ready [right on schedule](/article/release-management-4-1). Since the release of beta 3 we have identified all remaining regressions, thanks in a large part to your reports and extensive testing, and with the necessary fixes implemented we are publishing the first [Release Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate) today.

This is a great opportunity to give the new version of the engine a try. As the name suggests, a release candidate represents a build that we consider stable but want to be absolutely sure before making it official — with your help. If there are no significant regressions reported with release candidates, a stable version of Godot 4.1 is going to be published soon.

This release contains a [number of improvements](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-1-beta-1/#highlights) compared to Godot 4.0 published earlier this year. Some systems have also been reworked, which means projects that rely on those need to be updated. However, for most games and apps made with 4.0 it should be safe to migrate to 4.1. Don't forget to always make backups when moving versions, even minor. Better yet, prefer using a version control system, such as Git, and commit a version of your project before the migration.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also [try the **Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.1.rc1/) or the **Android editor** for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join [our testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds.

## Known issues

With every release we accept that there are going to be various issues, which have already been reported but haven't been fixed yet. See the GitHub issue tracker for a list of [known bugs in the 4.1 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.1+label%3Abug+).

Some notable issues are still tracked for a potential fix before 4.1-stable:
- The processing order for internal and normal node processing was mistakenly changed, causing issues such as [GH-77548](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/77548). You can help us test [GH-78745](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/78745) to validate that it solves the issue without further regression.
- The editor output dock doesn't update its scrollbar properly in some cases ([GH-78434](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/78434)). A potential solution is identified but we're not sure yet that it's safe to include in 4.1 at this late stage given the risk of regression.

## Bug reports

As a tester, we encourage you to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in 4.0.x, but no longer works in 4.1 RC 1).
