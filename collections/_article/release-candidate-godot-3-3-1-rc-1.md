We [released Godot 3.3 a couple of weeks ago](/article/godot-3-3-has-arrived), and feedback so far has been pretty good! But like with any major milestone, there are some bugs which are worth addressing with low-risk maintenance releases to further improve the experience for all Godot users.

The upcoming Godot 3.3.1, [like all future 3.3.x releases](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.3/about/release_policy.html), focuses purely on bug fixes, and aims to preserve compatibility. This [Release Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate) should help us validate the fixes done so far, and ensure that the release is ready to publish. As there is no new feature and only bug fixes, this RC 1 should be as stable as 3.3-stable and can be used in production if you need one of the fixes it includes.

As usual, you can try it live with the [**online version of the Godot editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/3.3.1.rc1/godot.tools.html) updated for this release.
