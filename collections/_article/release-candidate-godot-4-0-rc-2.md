The Godot 4.0 release is mere days away! We've had a [first release candidate](/article/release-candidate-godot-4-0-rc-1/) last week, and since then our contributors have been fully focused on fixing regressions and critical bugs to ensure that the upcoming 4.0 release will be a [great foundation to build upon](https://godotengine.org/article/release-management-4-0-and-beyond).

The Production team has been hard at work assessing the remaining PRs and issues in the 4.0 milestone, pushing non-critical or risky changes to the 4.1 milestone, or prioritizing what could actually still be done so close to the release. Astute watchers of the [4.0 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/9)'s completion ratio will have noticed a significant increase, but that doesn't mean that all issues are being solved. Some will be fixed in time for 4.1, and cherry-picked for 4.0.x maintenance releases along the way.

Regardless of which milestone our contributors assign to your issues, be sure to keep reporting any major or minor problem you're having with 4.0 RC 2! Your test reports at this stage are critical for us to assess whether we can finally stamp the current development branch as "stable" and release it to all platforms.

You should remove the `.import` files for your baked lightmaps generated with beta 17 or RC 1 if you want to apply this automatically (or change the compression option in the Import tab). Compressing lightmaps is recommended to optimize memory usage once you're happy with the results, though note that RC 2 still has a known issue exporting BPTC compressed files, which will be fixed in RC 3.

## Downloads

The downloads for this dev snapshot can be found directly on our repository:

* [Standard build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.0/rc2/) (GDScript, GDExtension).
* [.NET 6 build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.0/rc2/mono) (C#, GDScript, GDExtension).
  - Requires [.NET SDK 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) or [7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) installed in a standard location. .NET 7.0 support was recently merged and requires testing, please report any issue you experience with either version.

## Known issues

With every release we accept that there are going to be various issues, which have already been reported but haven't been fixed yet. See the GitHub issue tracker for a list of [known bugs in the 4.0 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.0+label%3Abug+).

- Exporting BPTC compressed textures (notably HDR textures with EXR format) is not working in this build ([GH-72856](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/72856)). The issue has been identified and a fix will be included in 4.0 RC 3 ([GH-73286](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/73286)).
- OpenGL windows with a `keep` stretch mode can show graphics artefacts in the bars outside the viewport ([GH-71799](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/71799)). This also has a fix queued for 4.0 RC 3 already ([GH-73300](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/73300)).

You will likely see this list reduced drastically over the coming days as we continue to re-triage those issues and postpone the ones that are not critical for the 4.0 release.

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

As in any major release, there are going to be compatibility-breaking changes. However, we still try to provide a migration path for your projects. If you experience a regression without a known migration path or workaround, do not hesitate to report it.
