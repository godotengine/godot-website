title: "Get ready for FOSDEM and GodotCon 2018!"
excerpt: "In February 2018, the Godot Engine community invites you to meet together at the FOSDEM (3 & 4 Feb) and the GodotCon (5 & 6 Feb), both in Brussels, Belgium and with dozens of Godot users and contributors, including our lead developer Juan Linietsky coming all the way from Buenos Aires. FOSDEM is a huge free and open source software-focused event with over 8000 attendees. Coming right after FOSDEM in the same city, GodotCon is a small but Godot-focused event with talks, workshops and many activities around our favourite engine."

[Last year in February](/article/meet-us-fosdem-2017-and-godotcon), we attended the [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/) and organized our very own **GodotCon** (a.k.a. *GDC*, the GoDot Convention), and it was a great community time for all who could attend in Brussels, Belgium.

For the coming year, we are lucky to be selected again to have a [Godot stand](https://fosdem.org/2018/stands/) at the [FOSDEM 2018](https://fosdem.org/2018/) on **3 & 4 February 2018** in Brussels, and we will organize another bigger [GodotCon](/events) on **5 & 6 February 2018**, also in Brussels.

And it gets better: our lead developer Juan "reduz" Linietsky is coming all the way from Buenos Aires to Europe to spend those four days with the community, so it's a great opportunity to meet one of the minds behind Godot Engine!

## TL;DR: Where do I sign up?

Both events are free of charge for everyone, and for the FOSDEM you do not even need to register: just show up and say hi at the Godot stand!

For GodotCon however, **registration is mandatory** as we need to know how many persons will be there to find an appropriate venue in Brussels. To help us with the organization, we ask that you register as soon as possible, and **before 31 December 2017**.

**Register here:** [https://framaforms.org/registration-for-godotcon-2018-1512567025](https://framaforms.org/registration-for-godotcon-2018-1512567025)

You can also indicate on that form if you plan to attend FOSDEM, so that we know who to expect.

## FOSDEM 2018

[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) is the major European event focusing on Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). Godot will have a stand there ([Building K, level 2](https://fosdem.org/2018/stands/)) where we will be distributing and selling some goodies (T-Shirts, stickers) and most importantly presenting our favourite engine and some games to the FOSDEM visitors. More than 8,000 visitors are awaited, and we hope that many will be impressed by our Godot 3.0 demos!

There *might* be some Godot-related talks, but we are still waiting for a confirmation from the FOSDEM organizers (the event is increasingly popular and they have hundreds of talk proposals to choose from).

The FOSDEM is a great opportunity to discover new projects ([see the stands](https://fosdem.org/2018/stands/)) and attend great talks ([see the schedule](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/) - still in progress) from top-notch free software contributors. It will also be the occasion to meet other Godot users and contributors, at our stand or around a few Belgian beers :)

**Practical infos** (location, schedule, etc.): See [FOSDEM.org](https://fosdem.org) and our [Events](/events) page.

## GodotCon 2018

*Update 10.01.2018:* [See this blog post](/article/godotcon-2018-venue-and-call-proposals) for information about the GodotCon venue as well as our Call for Proposals.

Two days in a crowded event is not enough! To get more time together to actually discuss our projects, learn new things and work together on games and on the engine, we are organizing a 2-day event focused on Godot right after the FOSDEM (on Monday 5 and Tuesday 6).

[Registrations are still ongoing](https://framaforms.org/registration-for-godotcon-2018-1512567025), but given the recent growth of the community we expect between 40 and 100 attendees; we'll size things accordingly so we need you to register as fast as possible to help us with the organization.

There will soon be a **Call for Proposals** so that everyone can propose a talk, a workshop or any kind of activity that we could do during those two days. Last year was a big success, and we expect the new GodotCon to be even better, both due to the higher number of attendees and the presence of our lead developer Juan!

The exact venue is still to be determined, as soon as we have a good overview about our numbers.

**Practical infos:** See our [Events](/events) page.

Looking forward to meeting some of you in Brussels!
