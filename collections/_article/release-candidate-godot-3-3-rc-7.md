*In case you missed the recent news, we decided to [change our versioning for Godot 3.x](/article/versioning-change-godot-3x) and **rename the upcoming version 3.2.4 to Godot 3.3**, thereby starting a new stable branch. Check the [dedicated blog post](/article/versioning-change-godot-3x) for details.*

This 7th [Release Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate) fixes [a number of regressions](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aregression+updated%3A2021-03-19..2021-03-30+milestone%3A3.3) which had been introduced since 3.2.3. Nearly all critical regressions have now been fixed, so we should be able to release Godot 3.3 stable in the near future.

If you haven't tried 3.3 RC builds yet, now would be a great time to do it to help us ensure everything upgrades smoothly from 3.2.3 to 3.3.

As usual, you can try it live with the [**online version of the Godot editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/3.3.rc7/godot.tools.html) updated for this release.

## Highlights

The main changes coming in Godot 3.3 and included in this Release Candidate are:

- [Android App Bundle](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/342) and [subview embedding](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/1064) support.
- [2D batching for GLES3](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/42119) (it was implemented for GLES2 in 3.2.2), and improvements to GLES2's batching.
- [A new software skinning for MeshInstance](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/40313) to replace the slow GPU skinning on devices that don't support the fast GPU skinning (especially mobile).
- [Rewritten and greatly improved FBX importer](/article/fbx-importer-rewritten-for-godot-3-2-4).
- [Improved Web editor](/article/godot-web-progress-report-3) and [AudioWorklet support for multithreaded HTML5 builds](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/43454).
- [Configurable amount of lights per object](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/43606), now defaulting to 32 instead of 8.
- [macOS ARM64 support](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/39788) in official binaries for Apple M1 chip (only standard build for now).
- [Optional GDNative support for HTML5](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44076).
- [MP3 loading and playback support](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/43007).
- [WebXR support for VR games](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/42397).

- [Fixes to Mono on WebAssembly](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44374).
- [New CPU lightmapper](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44628).
- [New dynamic <abbr title="Bounding Volume Hierarchy">BVH</abbr>](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44901) for rendering and the GodotPhysics backends.
  * If you experience a regression in either physics or rendering, you can try [these Project Settings](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44901#issuecomment-758618531) to revert back to the previous Octree-based approach and possibly fix the issue. In either case, be sure to report the problem on GitHub.
- [iOS plugins support](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/41340), with a similar interface to Android plugins.
- [Multiple fixes to one-way collisions](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/42574).
- [New `AspectRatioContainer` Control node](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/45129).
- [Implement pause-aware physics picking](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/39421).
- [Optimize transform propagation for hidden 3D objects](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/45583).
- [Improved Inspector sub-resource editing](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/45907).
- [Detect external modification of scenes](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/31747).
- [Add support for copy-pasting nodes](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/34892).
- [Modernization of the multi-threading APIs](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/45618).

- ["Keep" import mode to keep files as-is and export them](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/47268).

All these need to be thoroughly tested to ensure that they work as intended in the upcoming 3.3-stable.

The download links for dev snapshots are not featured on the [Download](/download) page to avoid confusion for new users. Instead, browse our download repository and fetch the editor binary that matches your platform:

- [Standard build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.3/rc7/) (GDScript, GDNative, VisualScript).
- [Mono build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.3/rc7/mono/) (C# support + all the above). You need to have MSBuild installed to use the Mono build. Relevant parts of Mono **6.12.0.122** are included in this build. (Note: Previous builds used Mono 6.12.0.114.)

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with 3.3 RC 7. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in 3.2.3 or earlier no longer works in 3.3 RC 7).
