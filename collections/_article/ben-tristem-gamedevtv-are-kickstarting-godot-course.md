If you are into game development, chances are that you've heard of [Ben Tristem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Tristem) and his [GameDev.tv](https://www.gamedev.tv/) team, as they are making some of the best-rated [online courses on Udemy](https://www.gamedev.tv/) for game engines like Unity3D and Unreal Engine 4, as well as art making tools like Blender and The GIMP.

## New professional Godot course on Kickstarter

Last week, Ben and his team started a new Kickstarter campaign for a [**Godot Engine course**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bentristem/discovering-godot-learn-to-code-by-making-games?ref=7dkj1f)!

In the Godot team, we are delighted to see them giving Godot the spotlight it deserves by making a top-quality professional course for the hundreds of thousands of Udemy users that learn with their material.

Their formula was tested and proven on other game engines, and we can't wait to see how they will approach Godot – we are confident that they will make a great course, as they plan to involve the backers and the greater Godot community to help them shape the final curriculum.

**Link:** [Discovering Godot – Learn to Code by Making Games](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bentristem/discovering-godot-learn-to-code-by-making-games?ref=7dkj1f) by Ben Tristem and Yann Burrett.

Make sure to check it out and to support the campaign if you can, as this course should be a great learning resource as well as a visibility boost for your favourite no-marketing-budget game engine :)
You'll see all the details about the course's purpose and contents [on the Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bentristem/discovering-godot-learn-to-code-by-making-games?ref=7dkj1f).

## Ben tells us why they support Godot

GameDev.tv had already been showing its interest in Godot by sponsoring us financially [on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/godotengine) over the last few months, and now they show their commitment and trust by actual making their own teaching product based on Godot.

> *We believe in the future of Godot, and that's the reason we've been sponsoring the project for a while. It's also the fundamental reason we're creating courses for the engine – to help support it and spread the word.*

I've asked Ben to give us some details about what they see in Godot, and why they are so enthusiastic about it and willing to give it a top-tier position among their game development courses:

> *We're big fans of Godot's:*
>
> - *Language flexibility*
> - *Separate 2D and 3D pipelines*
> - *Open source(ness), allowing users to modify and even contribute*
>
> *And it's fun! It's fun to use, it's simple when you open it, it's powerful if you need it, it unfolds the complexity as and when you require it. We find that so inviting!*

These points really echo what we hear on all [Godot community channels](https://godotengine.org/community), where users really enjoy the flexibility offered by Godot's design and license, and simply have a lot of fun experimenting and working on long term projects alike.

If you want to communicate directly with Ben, Yann and other users waiting for this course, you can join GameDev.tv's [Facebook group dedicated to the Godot course](https://www.facebook.com/groups/godotcourse/).
