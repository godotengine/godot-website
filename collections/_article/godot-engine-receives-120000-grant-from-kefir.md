We are delighted to announce that the game development studio [*Kefir*](https://kefirgames.ru) is giving the Godot Engine project a **USD 120,000** grant to fund further development of the engine. Thank you Kefir for supporting our free and open source game engine!

Kefir is known for hit survival games such as [*Last Day on Earth*](https://kefirgames.ru/games/last-day-on-earth), [*Grim Soul*](https://kefirgames.ru/games/grim-soul) and [*Frostborn*](https://www.facebook.com/playfrostborn/) (not made with Godot). They're currently using Godot for internal prototypes and are considering using it more in the future.

> *Many thanks to the Godot team for their incredible contribution to game development. It's a great honor for us to provide a little help in this grand endeavor. And we are always ready to support powerful, cool, and unusual games and teams, regardless of their platform, tools, and stage of development.*

<p style="text-align:right;">– Alyosha Stalin, Chief Business Development Officer, <a href="https://kefirgames.ru/">Kefir</a></p>

Like all grants, sponsoring and [donations](/donate) given to the not-for-profit Godot project, these funds are managed by our legal and fiscal sponsor [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org), and will be used to accelerate development of our free and open source game engine.

Such funding enables us to hire more contributors to work on the areas which need it most, as well as renew contracts for the currently hired contractors – always with the guarantee that all the work done by contractors is under Godot's MIT license and beneficial to the community as a whole.

We’re thankful to all users and companies in the Godot community who take part in making this open source game engine, be it with code, documentation, user support, bug reports, or funding.
