We released [Godot 4.4](/releases/4.4/) in early March and we are delighted to see the reception, with so many users upgrading to it on day 1 and sharing their favorite new changes on social media! If you haven't seen the [**4.4 release page**](/releases/4.4/), it's well worth a read!

Since then, we've started the development phase for Godot 4.5 at full speed (with a first [dev snapshot](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-5-dev-1/) released yesterday!), but we also put our main focus on fixing remaining and newly reported regressions that affect users who upgraded to 4.4. A few of these issues can be showstoppers for affected users, so we decided to release a 4.4.1 maintenance release as soon as possible.

After a first [4.4.1-rc1 snapshot](/article/release-candidate-godot-4-4-1-rc-1/) last week, we decided to make a second release candidate as a few more critical bugs had fixes available to backport. Please test it if you can and report any new issue that was not present in 4.4-stable, as we want to ensure we don't introduce new regressions in this hotfix release.

Maintenance releases are expected to be safe for an upgrade, but we recommend to always make backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.

Please, consider [supporting the project financially](#support), if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors. Your donations go towards sponsoring their work and ensuring they can dedicate their undivided attention to the needs of the project.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also [try the **Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.4.1.rc2/) or the **Android editor** for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join [our testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds.
