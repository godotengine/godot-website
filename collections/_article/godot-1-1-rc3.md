Many more issues were reported issues after RC2 ([changelog](https://web.archive.org/web/20150720151014/http://pastebin.com/AfsgAGy1)), so we’ll be releasing one more candidate.  This time, we’ll raise the bar so if nothing really serious is reported, this should go as  1.1 Stable!

New release in the [Download](/download) section, or at [GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/1.1-rc3).
