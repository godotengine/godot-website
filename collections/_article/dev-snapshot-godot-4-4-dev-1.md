This is the first dev snapshot for 4.4! During the beta and release candidate stages of 4.3, we accumulated a lot of PRs
that were of great quality, but deemed too risky to include in 4.3. We have begun merging those PRs now and have quickly
gathered a lot of changes that warrant a dev release!

Many of the changes in this release are bug fixes that will be backported to Godot 4.3 and released in 4.3.1! So please
test this release well so we can be confident with the changes and release 4.3.1 with them as soon as possible.

Keep in mind that while we try to make sure each dev snapshot is stable enough for general testing, this is by
definition a pre-release piece of software. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a version control system such as
Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.

Developed in Godot 4 by [AuntyGames](https://www.auntygames.com/), it was recently released [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2013730/Gourdlets/) to critical acclaim.

## Highlights

After just 10 days of development, we are bringing you a bunch of fixes and improvements, some of which are fairly massive new features!

### Metal rendering backend

We hinted that a Metal backend was in the works and it is finally here ([GH-88199](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/88199))! 

Metal is a low-level graphics API similar to Vulkan or D3D12. Godot currently supports using Vulkan or D3D12, but
neither of those are available on macOS and iOS, so we use a library called [MoltenVK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK)
to run Vulkan over Metal. MoltenVK is great and has worked well for us. However, having our own Metal implementation is more efficient
and allows us to have a greater control over what features we support and what performance tradeoffs we make.

Early results show that the Metal backend on macOS is at least as fast as the Vulkan backend and in many cases, much faster.

Right now, we only support Metal on Apple Silicon (ARM) devices. That includes all iOS devices and the M1/M2/M3 Macs. Intel-based
Apple devices will continue to work with the MoltenVK backend. Currently, this limitation is due to the fact that
few contributors working in this area have access to non-Apple Silicon devices.

### 3D physics interpolation

Godot 4.3 came with physics interpolation for 2D nodes, and now the 3D counterpart has been merged ([GH-92391](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92391))!
Not only that but support for MultiMeshes has also been merged ([GH-91818](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/91818))!

Physics interpolation is a technique that allows you to run your physics update at a very low FPS while maintaining
smooth movement. This allows you to both save CPU overhead and make your game look much smoother.

### Lightmap bicubic sampling

Bicubic sampling is a method for reading from a lightmap that smooths our sharp edges. It is especially useful when
you bake lightmaps with shadows at a low texture resolution. We supported this in Godot 3, and have now brought it back in
[GH-89919](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/89919).

![Comparison between shadows with bicubic on and off](/storage/blog/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-1/bicubic-compare.webp)

Bicubic sampling comes with a small run-time performance cost on the GPU, so it can be disabled in a project setting if needed.

Combined with new antialiasing for direct light samples ([GH-95828](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/95828)),
low resolution static shadows now look much better in lightmaps.

### Betsy texture compressor

The [Betsy](/article/betsy-gpu-texture-compressor/) texture compressor is a tool to compress
images into various GPU texture formats. Currently, compressing images for the GPU (in Godot using the "VRAM Compressed"
import setting) can be quite slow. Betsy is a texture compressor that runs on the GPU and is able to compress images
significantly faster than our current compressors. This reduces import time dramatically.

While Betsy was written a few years ago, we are just beginning to integrate it into the engine now ([GH-91535](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/91535)).
Currently it is only implemented for HDR images set to "high quality". However, soon we will extend it to many more
compression types and begin to use it internally for things like lightmaps.

The improvement is most obvious when importing HDRIs, here are a few examples from the PR:

| Image | CVTT | Betsy |
|-------|------|-------|
| [Symmetrical garden 8k .hdr with mipmaps](https://polyhaven.com/a/symmetrical_garden_02)          | 92.4s | 475ms |
| [Cobblestone Street Night .hdr 4k with mipmaps](https://polyhaven.com/a/cobblestone_street_night) | 26.5s | 217ms |
| [Laufenurg Church 8k .hdr with mipmaps](https://polyhaven.com/a/laufenurg_church)                 | 99.3s | 440ms |
| [Little Paris 8k .hdr with mipmaps](https://polyhaven.com/a/little_paris_eiffel_tower)            | 92.7s | 467ms |

Dev1 also brings optimizations to other stages of loading HDRIs that should make them much faster across the board:

- Optimize converting half float and full float formats (\~10× improvement) ([GH-92291](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92291)).
- Optimize loading HDRIs (\~25× improvement) ([GH-95291](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/95291)).

### Optimizations

Contributors have been hard at work on various optimizations across the engine. Now that Godot 4 is being used more and
the core feature set is feeling stable, we can turn our minds to optimizing the existing features. Many optimizations
were finished and tested before the 4.3 release but were too late to merge. So now we get them all in one big batch.

Here are a few:

- Core: Reduce memory allocations when formatting strings ([GH-94558](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/94558)).
    This makes formatting strings about 2× faster.
- Core: Optimize `Array.insert` ([GH-94353](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/94353)). This makes inserting new
    elements into an Array about 10× faster on average.
- Core: Optimize `String.insert` ([GH-92555](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92555)).
- Core: Optimize `String.join` ([GH-92550](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92550)).
- Core: Optimize `String.replace` ([GH-92546](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92546)).
- Import: Disable normal raycaster by default ([GH-93727](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/93727)). This makes
    importing meshes with LODs approximately 2× faster. We expect that the quality of imported LODs will be the same.
    If you notice any issues, please let us know. You can re-enable the raycaster in the object's import settings under
    `lods/raycast_normals`.
- Editor: Optimize editor grid recalculation ([GH-92734](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92734)).
- Editor: Optimize closing the editor settings ([GH-95704](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/95704)).
- Rendering: Optimize meshes for vertex cache ([GH-94241](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/94241)). In scenes
    with a lot of geometry, this can result in a 20% improvement in frame time. 
- Rendering: Optimize materials with `ambient_light_disabled` ([GH-92213](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92213)).
