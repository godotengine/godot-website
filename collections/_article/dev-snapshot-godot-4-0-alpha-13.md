We just announced that we'll enter [*feature freeze* next week](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-0-development-enters-feature-freeze) to focus on stabilizing the existing functionality in Godot 4.0 and prepare the first beta release. But we're not there yet and we'll keep having frequent alpha builds until we're ready to slap the *beta* label on the engine. So here we go with **4.0 alpha 13**!

**Update 2022-07-29 @ 10:30 UTC:** A regression was found in the original build that prevented exporting projects to Windows and Linux with official templates. All editor builds for this alpha have been [updated with a hotfix](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/63614). If you downloaded alpha 13 before this update, you can re-download the editor build for your platform. Export templates are unimpacted so you don't need to update them.

Some noteworthy changes in this release:

- Shader preprocessor support and shader includes.
- Grouping annotations for shaders (`uniform_group`).
- Vector4, Vector4i and Projection types.
- Support for loading system fonts on desktop and iOS.
- Peer visibility support in MultiplayerSynchronizer.
- Variable Rate Shading support.
- Worker Thread Pool.
- Feature build profiles for custom builds.

Be aware that during the alpha stage the engine is still not feature-complete or stable. **There will likely be breaking changes between this release and the first [*beta* release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta).** Only the beta will mark the so-called "feature freeze".

As such, we do not recommend porting existing projects to this and other upcoming alpha releases unless you are prepared to do it again to fix future incompatibilities. However, if you can port some existing projects and demos to the new version, that may provide a lot of useful information about critical issues still left to fix.

Most importantly: **Make backups before opening any existing project in Godot 4.0 alpha builds.** There is no easy way back once a project has been (partially) converted.

## Downloads

The downloads for this dev snapshot can be found directly on our repository:

* [Standard build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.0/alpha13/) (GDScript, GDExtension, VisualScript).
* Mono builds are currently not available as our focus is on porting to .NET 6. As soon as the .NET 6 port is ready to test, it will be included in dev snapshots.

## Known issues

As we are still in the alpha phase of development, there are still many issues to fix, some of which have already been reported and are being worked on.

See the GitHub issue tracker for a list of [known bugs in the 4.0 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.0+label%3Abug+).

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with 4.0 alpha 13. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

As in any major release there are going to be compatibility breaking changes. However, we still try to provide a migration path for your projects. If you experience a regression without a known migration path or workaround, do not hesitate to report it.
