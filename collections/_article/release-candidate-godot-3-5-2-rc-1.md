All contributors are incredibly busy working on Godot 4.0, which is having weekly beta releases (currently [beta 8](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-8), beta 9 likely tomorrow). Some of us are also doing significant work to prepare a first beta release of Godot 3.6, which will likely the last feature release in the 3.x series (expected to be finalized *after* the 4.0 release).

But we're not forgetting about the current stable branch, Godot 3.5, which had its first stable release in [early August](/article/godot-3-5-cant-stop-wont-stop), and a first maintenance release in [late September](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-5-1).

Since then, quite a few bugfixes have been queued in the `3.5` branch, so it's time to wrap up a new 3.5.2 maintenance release. But first, let's validate that those changes do not introduce regressions with a [Release Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate).

Please give it a try if you can. It should be as safe to use as 3.5.1-stable is, but we still need a significant number of users to try it out and report how it goes to make sure that the few changes in this update are working as intended and not introducing new regressions.
