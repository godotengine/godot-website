We released [Godot 3.5](/article/godot-3-5-cant-stop-wont-stop) one month ago, and like any release, there are few rough edges to iron out which warrant making maintenance "patch" releases (3.5.x).

A number of issues have been fixed already, so we're having a look at preparing the 3.5.1 update, starting with this [Release Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate) for users to help us validate those fixes and make sure that Godot 3.5.1 is ready to publish.

Please give it a try if you can. It should be as safe to use as 3.5-stable is, but we still need a significant number of users to try it out and report how it goes to make sure that the few changes in this update are working as intended and not introducing new regressions.

As usual, you can try it live with the [**online version of the Godot editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/3.5.1.rc1/) updated for this release.
