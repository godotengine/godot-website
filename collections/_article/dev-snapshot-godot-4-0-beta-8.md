Godot 4.0 has been in beta for [over two months](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-1), and the overall feature completeness, stability and usability have improved a lot during that time.

We initially had beta snapshots every other week, and now we've decided to accelerate the cadence to release a new snapshot every week, to get even faster feedback on our bugfixes, and the potential regressions they may introduce.

You can also [try the Web editor](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.0.beta8/godot.editor.html) (early testing, it's still slow and unstable).

*The illustration picture for this article is a screenshot of* **Sandfire**, *an upcoming 3D person action-adventure game by [Kmitt](https://twitter.com/kmitt91/). The game was recently ported to Godot 4, see [Kmitt's YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/channel/UCbf7bKRX6aTr1Tix1nTJo1Q) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kmitt91/) for devlogs and updates.*

## What's new

If you're interested in an overview of what's new in Godot 4.0 beta in general, have a look at the detailed release notes for [4.0 beta 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-1). In this blog post, we will only cover the main changes since the previous beta release.

See the [**changelog on GitHub**](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/compare/0ff8742919af72c7412e63ef0f646cb4e7bd7d8f...c6e40e1c01200052450df10d9126f8ea7f57de30), or the [**list of merged PRs**](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2022-11-30..2022-12-08+is%3Amerged+sort%3Acreated-asc+milestone%3A4.0), for an overview of all changes since 4.0 beta 7 (149 commits – excluding merge commits ― from 49 contributors).

While we do our best to minimize compatibility breaking changes for existing beta users, there are still occasional changes in the API which may impact your Godot 4 projects. See the list of PRs with the [`breaks compat` label](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2022-12-01..2022-12-08+is%3Amerged+sort%3Acreated-asc+milestone%3A4.0+label%3A%22breaks+compat%22) for details.

## Known issues

As we are still in the early beta phase of development, there are still many issues to fix, some of which have already been reported and are being worked on. See the GitHub issue tracker for a list of [known bugs in the 4.0 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.0+label%3Abug+).

Some notable regressions in this build:

- Moving/renaming resources cause unopened/unused tscn/res files to become corrupted ([GH-69794](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/69794)).

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

As in any major release there are going to be compatibility breaking changes. However, we still try to provide a migration path for your projects. If you experience a regression without a known migration path or workaround, do not hesitate to report it.
