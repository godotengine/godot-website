Do you love FLOSS Manuals? Do you love France in the summer? Come help us do a Booksprint for Godot Engine next week!

As you may know Ariel is spending some time in Hamburg, and since he's so close to France, the people from [Floss Manuals FR](http://www.flossmanualsfr.net/) invited him to do a Booksprint with them for Godot Engine! If you'd like to help, come down to Rennes, France next weekend to hang out! Check out these posts (in French) for more information:

--------------

*Edit:* The Booksprint was a success and the draft of the resulting book can be [consulted online on FlossManuals.net](fr.flossmanuals.net/godot-game-engine/_draft/_v/1.0/). All sections are not 100% finished yet, but feel free to give us suggestions for improvements!
