We [released Godot 3.3 a few weeks ago](/article/godot-3-3-has-arrived), and feedback so far has been pretty good! But like with any major milestone, there are some bugs which are worth addressing with low-risk maintenance releases to further improve the experience for all Godot users.

Godot 3.3.1, [like all future 3.3.x releases](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.3/about/release_policy.html), focuses purely on bug fixes, and aims to preserve compatibility. It is a recommended upgrade for all Godot 3.3 users.
