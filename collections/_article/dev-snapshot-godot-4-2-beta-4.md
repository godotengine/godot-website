We're well into the beta phase for Godot 4.2, with the first beta released 3 weeks ago, and new beta snapshots every week since. Have a look at the [4.2 beta 1 release notes](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-2-beta-1/) for an overview of the key changes in Godot 4.2.

Since the start of the beta phase, we fixed a number of bugs reported by the community, so we're publishing further beta snapshots to validate those fixes, and iterate closer to the release candidate stage.

This fourth beta snapshot fixes a number of regressions around rendering and the handling of [mesh compression upgrades](https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-2-beta-1/#rendering-particles-and-shaders), compatibility issues with the refactored particles system, and exporting projects to Android.

For C# users, the .NET 8.0 release is set to be launched this November. Make sure to try the current preview release ([`8.0.0-rc.2`](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)) with Godot to make sure everything works as expected. Note that you need to set the `DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD_TO_PRERELEASE` environment variable to `1` to be able to use the release candidate version of .NET 8.0.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also [try the **Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.2.beta4/) or the **Android editor** for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join [our testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds.
