Godot 4.1 is shaping up to be ready [right on schedule](/article/release-management-4-1). Over the course of the beta testing phase, and with our first two [Release Candidates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate) last week, we identified and fixed a number of regressions, i.e. recently introduced bugs that would worsen the experience compared to Godot 4.0. Now we're fairly confident that we've handled most of those, and the remaining issues we're tracking will likely be deferred to a fix in future 4.1.x maintenance releases.

Our contributors managed to fix a few more critical regressions during the testing phase of RC 2, which justified making a third release candidate to validate those changes. If all goes well, we should be on track for a 4.1 release in a few days. Please keep reporting issues that you encounter with the RC, even if you don't think they're critical – while triaging them, we might prioritize them for early on in the 4.2 development cycle, and backport the fixes to 4.1.x.

This release contains a [number of improvements](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-1-beta-1/#highlights) compared to Godot 4.0 published earlier this year. Some systems have also been reworked, which means projects that rely on those need to be updated. However, for most games and apps made with 4.0 it should be safe to migrate to 4.1. Don't forget to always make backups when moving versions, even minor. Better yet, prefer using a version control system, such as Git, and commit a version of your project before the migration.
