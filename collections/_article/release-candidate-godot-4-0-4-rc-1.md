We are committed to providing support for multiple minor versions of Godot at the same time, as long as we have the capacity to do the work and there are fixes that can be safely backported. So even if your project cannot be migrated to [Godot 4.1](/article/maintenance-release-godot-4-1-1) right now, we still want to share with you some positive changes.

It has been a few weeks since the release of Godot 4.0.3, which means it's high time for the next maintenance version! As is always the case with patch releases, 4.0.4 is focused on stability and bug fixes, as well as adding missing documentation. One important change in this release is a security fix for a potential denial of service when using ENet:
- If your project uses `ENetMultiplayerPeer` or the low-level `ENetConnection`, then we strongly recommend updating to this version once it is released as stable. Be sure to test the build right now to prepare and have a smooth transition. Thanks to [Facundo Fern√°ndez](https://github.com/Facundo15) for reporting this vulnerability. A patch has been submitted to the upstream ENet repository as well.

This is a Release Candidate, which means that we don't expect regressions or new major issues. Please give it a good test if you are currently using Godot 4.0 in your project. Unless a critical problem is discovered, a stable release will follow RC 1 shortly. Remember to always make backups when changing engine version, or better yet, prefer using a version control system, such as Git, to have a safety net in cases of data corruption or loss.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also [try the **Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.0.4.rc1/) or the **Android editor** for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join [our testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds.

*The illustration picture for this article is from a game called* [**Sunken Shadows**](https://alghost.itch.io/sunken-shadows). *It's a 32-bit first person roguelike created by a team of [Milan Gruner](https://gruner.tech/) and friends with Godot 4. Fight aquatic creatures with your trusty knife which doubles as a grappling hook, and learn what lurks down below! You can get the game, currently in development, from [itch.io](https://alghost.itch.io/sunken-shadows).

## What's new

**72 contributors** submitted almost **160 improvements** for this release. You can review the complete list of changes with our [interactive changelog](https://godotengine.github.io/godot-interactive-changelog/#4.0.4-rc1), which contains links to relevant commits and PRs for this and every previous release. Below are the most notable changes:

- 2D: Don't create bones from empty scene ([GH-77473](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/77473)).
- 2D: Draw materials in tile atlas view ([GH-77909](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/77909)).
- 2D: Fix various crashes in the tileset editor ([GH-77382](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/77382), [GH-78165](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/78165), [GH-78796](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/78796)).
- 3D: Fix CSGPolygon3D in path mode disappearing at runtime ([GH-77118](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/77118)).
- Animation: Adjust BoneAttachment3D children/meshes during rest fixer ([GH-77123](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/77123)).
- Animation: Fix `get_bone_global_pose_no_override()` returning incorrect values ([GH-77194](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/77194)).
  - If you have relied on the previous behavior of this method, this change may lead to unexpected issues. You can fix them by replacing calls to `get_bone_global_pose_no_override(bone)` with `get_bone_global_pose(get_bone_parent(bone)) * get_bone_pose(bone)`, which should give you the same value as before.
  - This change may be reverted before going stable as behavioral changes, even to fix bugs, are out of scope for maintenance releases for this very reason.
