After a couple of years of online-only events, we are bringing back some in-person Godot events. More precisely, today we are announcing two events taking place at Barcelona: a Godot Sprint for contributors (June 2nd & 3rd) and a Godot User Meeting (June 4th). Both events will be free of charge.

## What are Godot Sprint and Godot User Meeting?

### Godot Sprint - June 2 & 3, 2022 (10:00 to 19:30)

The Godot Sprint is a two-day event dedicated to engine contributors. As we usually work together online and discuss via Rocket.Chat or GitHub, we use opportunities like Godot Sprint to finally talk together IRL, which lets us discuss a number of technical topics and reach consensus much faster.

So this event is mostly meetings focusing on specific contribution-related topics, such as the development roadmap, how to improve our workflows, onboarding of new contributors, as well as many technical topics which are of interest to the attendees.

And of course this is a great opportunity to get to know each other better, which also greatly improves our ability to contribute efficiently towards common goals and make Godot an ever greater engine.

If you're not a contributor yet but would like to become one, or are curious about a community-driven FOSS project operates, you are welcome to attend the Godot Sprint too.

The Godot Sprint will take place at the Lleialtat Santsenca space in Barcelona.

### Godot User Meeting - June 4, 2022 (10:00 to 20:00)

The first official Godot User Meeting will be a full day event, taking place on June 4th at the Lleialtat Santsenca space in Barcelona. It will be a meeting point for Godot users and engine contributors in which to share experiences and get to know each other.

We mostly invite Godot users from Barcelona and the neighboring regions to join us for a day, meet each other and core contributors after the Sprint. There will be some space for game demos and a few talks by community members, which we will detail as the event gets closer.
