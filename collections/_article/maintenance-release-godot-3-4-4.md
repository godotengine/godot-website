In parallel to our work on the upcoming feature releases Godot 3.5 ([with a second beta](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-3-5-beta-2)) and 4.0 ([now at alpha 4!](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-alpha-4)), we backport important fixes to the stable 3.4 branch for use in production.

Last month's [3.4.3 release](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-4-3) was found to have a few regressions that could affect a lot of users, so we've been working on a bugfix-only release to solve those issues and a few other pre-existing issues. All users are advised to upgrade to Godot 3.4.4 for the best possible experience.

[**Download Godot 3.4.4 now**](/download) or try the [online version of the Godot editor](https://editor.godotengine.org/3.4.4.stable/).

**Note:** The Windows editor binaries are signed with an expired certificate. We will re-sign them as soon as a new certificate is available.

**Edit 2022-03-24 @ 12:15 UTC:** There was a slight packaging mistake affecting the macOS editor, and the iOS and macOS export templates, as well as a build issue affecting the iOS `debug` template. These binaries have been updated on the mirror, users who downloaded Godot 3.4.4 before this edit are advised to re-download at least the export templates if they intend to export to iOS.
