We are thrilled to announce the much-anticipated GodotCon 2023, set to take place in Munich, Germany. Mark your calendars for **November 4th and 5th**, 2023, as these two days will be packed with talks, Godot games, workshops, and the chance to meet your fellow Godot contributors in person! No matter if you're a beginner or an experienced Godot user, there’s something for everyone.

There will soon be a **Call for Proposals** so that anyone can propose a talk, a workshop or any kind of activity that we could do during those two days. This will be the biggest Godot event to date, and we want to make sure that everyone can participate in some way.

If you are not able to come, we plan on recording the talks and workshops and making them available online. We'll try to also stream the event so you can watch it live wherever you are, but we can't promise anything yet.

## Location

With heartfelt appreciation, we extend our thanks to a passionate team of Munich locals who have been instrumental in organizing this event. Their dedication and support have made it possible for us to be hosted at [Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/) Germany, whose generous offer of their space allows us to bring this remarkable event to life.  

📍 Address: [Walter-Gropius-Str. 5, 80807 München, Germany](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/428992680).
