Our biggest milestone in 4 years, Godot 4.0, has just been [released a month ago](/article/godot-4-0-sets-sail/). The reception has been great, and we're already hard at work on the 4.1 milestone with a bunch of improvements. But that doesn't mean we're forgetting Godot 3 users and their projects, which they plan to maintain for months or years to come.

The current stable Godot 3 version, 3.5, has just received a new [maintenance update](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-5-2/), addressing several reported issues. At the same time we've been working on the next feature update to the 3.x branch — Godot 3.6.

The development is slower paced, as most contributors focus on the 4.x branch, which is where the future of Godot lies. But little by little, improvements and bugfixes are being backported and we've accumulated enough of those now to propose a **3.6 beta 1**, to start the testing phase leading to the stable release.
