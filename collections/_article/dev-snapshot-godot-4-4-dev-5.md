With [GodotCon](https://godotengine.org/article/review-godotcon24/) behind us and our developers recuperated, we're thrilled to return
to a more frequent release-cycle. It's only been two weeks since we last checked in, yet there's still so much to talk about!
So buckle on in for a breakdown of what you can expect to see in 4.4 dev 5.

Many of the changes in this release are bug fixes that will be backported to Godot 4.3 and released in 4.3.1! So please
test this release well so we can be confident with the changes and release 4.3.1 with them as soon as possible.

Keep in mind that while we try to make sure each dev snapshot is stable enough for general testing, this is by
definition a pre-release piece of software. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a version control system such as
Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release.

## Highlights

In case you missed them, see the [4.4 dev 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-1/), [4.4 dev 2](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-2/),
[4.4 dev 3](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-3/), and [4.4 dev 4](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-4/) release notes for an overview of
some key features which were already in that snapshot, and are therefore still available for testing in dev 5.

Here are highlights of a few new features in dev 5 that you might find particularly exciting!

### Universalize UID support

Previously, the <abbr title="Universal ID">UID</abbr> format was not supported by all Resource types. This proved to be a pain point for users wishing to reference their scripts and other resources in a manner that's path-agnostic. This, along with a need to refactor their scripts anytime these kinds of files were moved, put a significant duty of care on the end-user that shouldn't have been necessary.

Starting with dev 5, this will no longer be your burden to bear! Thanks to a long-term effort from [reduz](https://github.com/reduz), UIDs will now be applied universally in a way the engine can automatically track and account for. This is achieved via `.uid` files for the resource types that previously didn't support them, functioning similarly to other metadata files that "track" a main file.

Note that, unlike metadata files, `.uid` files are strictly for the editor; the information is migrated to the uid database on export. Despite this, users using version control software **should add these files**, as they're required to properly sync data (similar to `.import` files). For more information, see ([GH-97352](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/97352)).

### Favorite editor items

A common complaint we hear regarding the inspector is the potential for it to get cluttered. Namely, while there's generally a wide selection of options available for a given class/script, users will usually only care about a particular subsection that suits them. To account for this, [YeldhamDev](https://github.com/YeldhamDev) brings us the long-awaited ability to pin one's favorite properties in the inspector! Check out the implementation from PR ([GH-97352](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/97415)) below:
