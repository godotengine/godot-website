Godot 3.2.2 was [released on June 26](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-2-2) with over 3 months' worth of development, including many bugfixes and a handful of features. Some regressions were noticed after the release though, so we decided that Godot 3.2.3 would focus mainly on fixing those new bugs to ensure that all Godot users can have the most stable experience possible.

Here's a third [Release Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate) for the upcoming Godot 3.2.3 release. Please help us test it to ensure that no new regressions have slipped through code review and testing.

**Note:** The previous 3.2.3 **RC 2** was actually not built from the intended commit, and reflected the same changeset as RC 1. Tests made on RC 2 are still valid and useful, but did not help validate the very latest commits, hence this third release candidate. The changes new in this build are thus the ones made [between RC 1 and RC 3](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/compare/a24e30abd7b1bc226dc1231ef2b8eb5a9ee50df6...23b553ba0603161346526e1821bff5002520173c).

If all goes well, the 3.2.3-stable release should happen ~~later this week~~ when I'm back from holidays :)

## Downloads

The download links for dev snapshots are not featured on the [Download](/download) page to avoid confusion for new users. Instead, browse our download repository and fetch the editor binary that matches your platform:

- [Classical build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2.3/rc3/) (GDScript, GDNative, VisualScript).
- [Mono build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2.3/rc3/mono/) (C# support + all the above). You need to have MSBuild installed to use the Mono build. Relevant parts of Mono 6.6.0.166 are included in this build.

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with 3.2.3 RC 3. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in 3.2.1 or 3.2.2 no longer works in 3.2.3 RC 3).
