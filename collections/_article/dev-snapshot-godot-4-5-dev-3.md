If the past snapshot was any indication, you might think that development updates aren't slowing down anytime soon. And… You'd be right! Indeed, progress has been booming, and the amount of new features added even compared to the previous release is staggering; curating this selection was especially difficult. As always, new features mean new bugs in need of fixing, so we encourage everyone interested to get feedback and bug reports in as early as possible.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also [try the **Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.5.dev3/) or the **Android editor** for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join [our testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds.

*The cover illustration is from* [**Cornerpond**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3454590/Cornerpond/?curator_clanid=41324400), *a fishing game that takes place entirely in the corner of your desktop. It is developed by [foolsroom](https://foolsroom.itch.io/). You can get the game [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3454590/Cornerpond/?curator_clanid=41324400) and follow the developer on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/foolsroom).*

## Highlights

In case you missed them, see the [4.5 dev 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-5-dev-1/) and [4.5 dev 2](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-5-dev-2/) release notes for an overview of some key features which were already in that snapshot, and are therefore still available for testing in dev 3.

### Screen reader support

Accessibility should be every developer's top priority, full-stop. Someone being excluded from an experience for factors outside of their control is an area that video games and applications have the potential to circumvent entirely. It does, however, take a solid framework to allow such accommodations to be developed. To streamline this process for everyone—players and developers alike—our resident tech guru [bruvzg](https://github.com/bruvzg) took to the absolutely Herculean task of integrating [AccessKit](https://github.com/AccessKit/accesskit) to Godot as a whole.

[GH-76829](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76829) was a project started two years ago, which progressed in bursts alongside the AccessKit framework. For the 4.5 release, we made it a priority to finalize, and thus we now merged this major feature with over **32,000** lines of code, after hundreds of comments with feedback/testing. Users are encouraged to look at the pull request for more information, as there's no feasible way we could properly summarize these changes. Unsurprisingly, this was *by far* the change with the most ramifications of the entire snapshot, so much so that it's already seen [multiple](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/105197) [fixes](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/105216) to address regressions (even [one](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/105764) right when validating this snapshot), but it's well worth it. After all, accessibility is our top priority!

This is only the first but massive step towards making Godot more accessible. In particular for the editor, a lot more work will be needed to make it really usable, as well as integrate with accessibility frameworks for mobile or web platforms.

### Script backtracing

In any other snapshot, this would've been the main highlight, as adding backtracing to GDScript was among the most highly requested features from our users for years. Two brave souls, [Mikael Hermansson](https://github.com/mihe) (godot-jolt) and [Juan Linietsky](https://github.com/reduz) (up-and-coming developer), helmed this task and made this process possible with [GH-91006](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/91006). This will make it much easier for users to find the cause of warnings/errors that previously required manually hunting down bugs. Stack traces are now available in projects exported in release mode as well if the **Debug > Settings > GDScript > Always Track Call Stacks** project setting is enabled. This can make it easier for users to report issues in a way that developers can track down.

### Inspector section toggles

Another long-awaited feature, inspector section toggles, is now a part of the engine as of [GH-105272](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/105272). [lodetrick](https://github.com/lodetrick) has expanded editor functionality to what you see below: sections with their own dedicated checkbox to denote if they're enabled.
