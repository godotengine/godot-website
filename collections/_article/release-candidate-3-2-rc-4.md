title: "Release candidate: Godot 3.2 RC 4"
excerpt: "Last check before takeoff! This 4th release candidate should be the last one, meant to validate the current state of the `master` branch before releasing it as 3.2-stable!
It's the last chance to test the new release and report any critical issue, otherwise its fix will have to wait for the 3.2.1 maintenance update in coming weeks."

We're now very close to the final 3.2 stable release! To validate the last changes done over the weekend before actually releasing the new version, he's a (likely) final Release Candidate. If no new critical regression is found with this build, 3.2 stable should be more or less the same.

Over [350 issues](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+closed%3A2020-01-01..2020-01-27+-label%3Aarchived+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A3.2) have been fixed in January alone, bringing the 3.2 version to a very good standard.

Notable changes since RC 3:

- Editor: Fixed Inspector update when a node is renamed, which made shader editor disappear on errors ([GH-35526](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/35526)).
- GLES2: Fix Softbody always spawns from world center ([GH-35495](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/35495)).
- GLES3: Add project setting for max irradiance size ([GH-35561](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/35561)).
- Mono: Fix C# preprocessor infinite loop and incorrect parsing of `#if!` ([GH-35524](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/35524)).
- Mono: Fix `_update_exports` possible crash with Reference types ([GH-35527](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/35527)).
- PathFollow: Fix regression with looping starting at non-0 position ([GH-35515](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/35515)).
- Thirdparty: mbedtls: Update to upstream version 2.16.4 (security bugfix) ([GH-35596](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/35596)).
- Documentation and translation updates.

For those following our dev snapshots closely, [63 commits](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/compare/8a7a216be5dfbd8e2b7f32c39a92bbecec9306ca...9daaa12bae0cd3637da8f401333b3bc522aee66e) have been merged since 3.2 RC 3 last Friday. This release is built from commit [9daaa12](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/9daaa12bae0cd3637da8f401333b3bc522aee66e).

## Disclaimer

**IMPORTANT: This is a *[release candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate)* build, which means that it is *not suitable* yet for use in production, nor for press reviews of what Godot 3.2 would be on its release.**

There will still be various fixes made before the final release, and we will need your [detailed bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) to debug issues and fix them.

## The features

Release notes are not finalized yet, but you can refer to the [detailed changelog](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) now included in the `master` branch.

Our [past devblogs](https://godotengine.org/devblog) should also give you an idea of the main highlights of the upcoming release. Note that the Vulkan port outlined in Juan's latest posts is developed in a separate branch for Godot 4.0, and is not included in this release.

The [latest branch](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/) of the documentation includes details on many of the new 3.2 features and API.

For changes since the last RC build, see [the list of commits](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/compare/8a7a216be5dfbd8e2b7f32c39a92bbecec9306ca...9daaa12bae0cd3637da8f401333b3bc522aee66e).

## Downloads

The download links are not featured on the [Download](/download) page for now to avoid confusion for new users. Instead, browse one of our download repository and fetch the editor binary that matches your platform:

- [Classical build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2/rc4/) (GDScript, GDNative, VisualScript).
- [Mono build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2/rc4/mono) (C# support + all the above). You need to have MSBuild installed to use the Mono build. Relevant parts of Mono 6.6.0.161 are included in this build.

**IMPORTANT:** Make backups of your Godot 3.1 projects before opening them in any 3.2 development build.

## Bug reports

We're now down to [a handful of issues](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.2+label%3Abug+) which are still short-listed for 3.2, but unlikely to be fixed in time for the release. We'll keep them on the priority list for an upcoming 3.2.1 maintenance release in a few weeks.

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with 3.2 RC 4. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in 3.1.x no longer works in 3.2).
