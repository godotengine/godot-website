[Godot 3.4.3 was released less than 2 weeks ago](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-4-3), but a few significant regressions were found in that release, so we're fast-tracking the release of Godot 3.4.4 to solve those.

This [Release Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate) adds a handful of fixes, including several regression fixes. Please make sure to test it on your projects and to report any issue, so that we can release 3.4.4 stable in the coming days.

As usual, you can try it live with the [**online version of the Godot editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/3.4.4.rc1/) updated for this release.

## Changes

Here are the main changes since 3.4.3-stable:

- Animation: Fix cubic interpolate when looping ([GH-58651](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/58651)).
- Audio: Revert "PitchShift effect quality and performance tweaks for different pitch scale values" ([GH-58668](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/58668)) **[regression fix]**.
  * This fixed a valid issue while introducing a new one, so it was reverted for the time being until a better fix can be found.
- Core: Print every file exported with `PCKPacker.flush()`'s verbose parameter ([GH-58520](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/58520)).
- Core: Fix `UndoRedo::create_action()` invalid memory usage ([GH-58652](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/58652)).

- Editor: Fix showing Extend Script option without script attached to the node ([GH-58821](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/58821)).
- HTML5: Revert "[HTML5] Fetch API now passes credentials." ([GH-58862](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/58862)) **[regression fix]**.
  * This turned out not to be a good option with the current state of the web standard.
- iOS: Fix multitouch not working correctly ([GH-58586](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/58586)) **[regression fix]**.
- Physics: Fix premature return in GodotPhysics Area `call_queries` ([GH-58531](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/58531)).
- Physics: Update joints on `NOTIFICATION_POST_ENTER_TREE` ([GH-58642](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/58642)).
