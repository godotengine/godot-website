While 2020 was a difficult year for most of us, it's been a great year for Godot development! A lot of new features were implemented for both 4.0 and 3.2.x, from Vulkan rendering to HTML5 export improvements. Many long-requested features are now available in the `master` branch, such as support for right-to-left typesetting and complex scripts (which are required to display text in Arabic, Hebrew, â€¦). On top of that, GDScript has been rewritten from scratch and C# has received continuous improvements and fixes throughout the year.

In the spirit of [last year's retrospective article](https://godotengine.org/article/retrospective-and-future), we made a [**video showcasing various features that have been developed in 2020**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lm-veva15g).
