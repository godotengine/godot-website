We are back with another big dev update with over 330 commits merged in the last few weeks! Contributors continue to
work on amazing new things while we continue to merge our backlog of important features that missed the 4.3 cutoff. The
combined result is a lot of great stuff compressed into a short amount of time.

Many of the changes in this release are bug fixes that will be backported to Godot 4.3 and released in 4.3.1! So please
test this release well so we can be confident with the changes and release 4.3.1 with them as soon as possible.

Keep in mind that while we try to make sure each dev snapshot is stable enough for general testing, this is by
definition a pre-release piece of software. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a version control system such as
Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release.

It is developed in Godot 4.3 by [Mad Cookies Studio](https://x.com/MadCookiesGames). You can wishlist the game [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219010/Fogpiercer/) and follow the developers on [Twitter](https://x.com/MadCookiesGames).*

## Highlights

In case you missed them, see the [4.4 dev 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-1/) and [dev 2](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-2/) release notes for an overview of some
key features which were already in that snapshot, and are therefore still available for testing in dev 3.

Here are a few highlights that you might find particularly exciting!

### `@export_tool_button` annotation

Being able to create a button in the inspector from tool scripts was a highly requested feature, and many contributors
took it upon themselves to make it happen in [GH-96290](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/96290): new
contributors [jordi-star](https://github.com/jordi-star) and [Macksaur](https://github.com/Macksaur), and maintainers
[Ernest](https://github.com/fire) and [Danil](https://github.com/dalexeev)!

This new feature allows you to be even more expressive with the dev tooling that you can easily create with `@tool`
scripts.

Let's take a look at an example:

```gdscript
@tool
extends Sprite2D

# With a callable (could also be a local function).
@export_tool_button("Toot", "Callable")
var print_action = print.bind("toot")

# With a lambda.
@export_tool_button("Randomize Color", "ColorRect")
var color_action = func(): self_modulate = Color(randf(), randf(), randf())
```

### Massively optimized scene startup for large projects

Work has not slowed down on improving the scene startup experience, still thanks to amazing contributions by
[Hilderin](https://github.com/Hilderin). This dev snapshot introduces a massive improvement to editor load speed for
large projects ([GH-95678](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/95678)). Large projects can expect up to a 3×
speed improvement when loading the project and a similar speedup when doing any operations that scan the filesystem.

### Vertex shading

This dev release re-introduces the long-awaited vertex shading option for materials
([GH-83360](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/83360)), thanks to contributor [ywmaa](https://github.com/ywmaa)
landing their second major feature in Godot, after export support for
[Blender Geometry Nodes](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/87735).
Vertex shading is used primarily to achieve an early PSX style and to optimize performance on older and lower-end
devices.

You can enable vertex shading either from within an existing `StandardMaterial3D`, `ORMMaterial3D`, `ShaderMaterial`,
or by force enabling it on all materials using the `rendering/shading/overrides/force_vertex_shading` project setting.

### Add batching to RendererCanvasRenderRD

After tackling the [Metal rendering backend](https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-1/#metal-rendering-backend)
merged in an earlier snapshot, [Stuart](https://github.com/stuartcarnie/) took on another impressive rendering
contribution: 2D batching!

Batching has been implemented in the Compatibility renderer since the release of 4.0. This release brings the same
performance benefits to the other backends by implementing batching when using the Forward+ and Mobile backends
([GH-92797](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92797)). Now 2D performance is comparable between all backends.

Batching is a performance optimization that drastically reduces the number of draw calls in a scene. The benefits of
batching will be particularly noticeable in scenes with a lot of text rendering or repeated sprites that share a texture
(e.g. when using tilemaps or making a bullet hell).

We have further improvements planned for batching on the RD backends that should allow it to be even faster than the
Compatibility backend. Stay tuned for updates in later dev releases!

### Expression evaluator (REPL) in the debugger

The expression evaluator adds a new tab to the bottom panel that allows you to evaluate expressions using the local
state of your scripts while stopped at a breakpoint. Many users are familiar with this workflow from other
[REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) debuggers.

This feature has been a work in progress for awhile and was recently finished and merged in
([GH-97647](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/97647)), thank you to [Oğuzhan](https://github.com/rohanrhu),
[Erik](https://github.com/rxlecky), and [Tomek](https://github.com/KoBeWi/) for bringing it across the finish line.

### Implement autostart for all profilers

A common complaint from users is that they need to go back to the editor once they start their game in order to enable
the profiler. This made it hard to measure performance in the first few seconds of loading a scene and was an overall
hassle for developers.

[Hendrik](https://github.com/Geometror) introduced a checkbox that allows you to set the profiler to automatically start
when you run the engine and capture valuable profiling data immediately
([GH-96759](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/96759)).

![Auto start checkbox in profiler](/storage/blog/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-3/auto-start.webp)

### Add markers to Animation

Markers allow you to create sub regions of an animation that can be jumped to, or looped without playing the entire
animation. 

<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="/storage/blog/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-3/markers.mp4?1" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Markers are even supported inside the Animation Tree, where you can easily select animation markers for looping or to
begin playback.

For more details check out the pull request [GH-91765](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/91765), which was one
of the first Godot contributions of [ChocolaMint](https://github.com/chocola-mint)!

### Linux camera support

Previously, Godot only supported accessing the device camera on macOS and iOS devices.
[pkowal1982](https://github.com/pkowal1982)'s long-running pull request [GH-53666](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/53666)
was finally merged and adds support for the Linux platform, allowing developers to access connected cameras from within
their game.

### Fallback to OpenGL 3 if other rendering drivers are not supported

Currently when trying to run Godot with the Forward+ or Mobile backend on a device that doesn't support Vulkan, D3D12,
or Metal, the engine will provide the user with an OS alert notifying them that they don't have support for the needed
graphics API and they need to try again with the Compatibility backend. This alert has proven to be confusing for users
and the process of opening the scene ends up being cumbersome.

Now with [GH-97142](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/97142), first contribution from
[SheepYhangCN](https://github.com/SheepYhangCN), the engine will automatically fall back to using OpenGL (the
Compatibility backend) when the other backends are not available. This should provide the smoothest possible experience
for users on older devices.

Since the Compatibility backends can look different from the other backends, game developers may not want Godot to
automatically fall back. In that case, they can disable the `rendering/rendering_device/fallback_to_opengl3` project
setting to avoid falling back, and users with OpenGL-only devices would then get notified that their hardware is not
supported.
