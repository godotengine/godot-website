Variety was the name of the game this year. GodotCon keeps going around the globe and adds more activities to the program: the event team made up of volunteers and Godot Foundation staff put a lot work into making this more than a mere meetup occasion for the ever-growing community forming around the Godot Engine. 

Judging by the smiley pictures taken all around the [Silent Green](https://www.silent-green.net/) venue, and the excited chatter about what the next installments might bring to the table, we seem to have hit the sweet spot for our 574 attendees. For those of you that couldn‚Äôt be there yourself - considering both ticket batches sold out within an hour - join us on a retrospective walk through GodotCon, highlighting all the wonderful speakers, exhibitors, and sponsors that made this event possible.

# Sponsor support
GodotCon 2024 wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without the generosity of [our sponsors](https://conference.godotengine.org/2024/#sponsors), who enabled us to bring this event to life.

## Critical Reflex
Having a publisher with experience in Godot on-board was as exciting for us as it seemed for the audience of ‚ÄúIndie Publishing 101‚Äù by their business developer Daniel. Additionally, you might have spotted the goodie bags they provided us.

## Endless Foundation
‚ÄúBlock Coding: Making Godot Accessible to Learners Everywhere‚Äù was another well-visited talk on the agenda, as was the booth of the biggest exhibitor team onsite. Their tech demonstration drew in fellow educators as well as curious game developers looking to contribute.

## W4 Games
Port your Godot games to console with ease! The company founded by Godot Engine veterans explained ‚ÄúW4's role in the Godot Ecosystem‚Äù on stage and let you playtest their products and talk business at their busy booth.

## Poki
The provider of free online games also has shown interest in Godot before and is hoping to expand their selection with your projects. We talked with them about improving Godot for the Web together; let‚Äôs see what the future might bring!

## AWS
After demonstrating ‚ÄúHow to quick start a Godot Engine game on AWS‚Äù, the cloud provider team spent time answering questions on the exhibition floor.

# Game exhibition
For the first time ever, we tried curating a selection of projects ahead of time and invited game development teams to a showcase on the venue floors. Decorated booths and sometimes even goodies caught the eyes of many attendees, and provided the exhibitors with valuable playtest information as well as wishlists. Some told us this was the first event they participated in with their project!

# Activities

<img alt="The graffiti canvas full of different drawings by the visitors" src="/storage/blog/godotcon24/canvas.webp"/>

What do you do at a conference, besides watching talks, browsing through the exhibition, or doing business? Have some fun and get to know other attendees in a casual way, of course.

This is exactly what we aimed to facilitate with our onsite activities, especially the [sticker challenge](https://conference.godotengine.org/2024/activities/) tying them all together (since many of you asked: the stickers were designed by community artist [Tibo](https://gotibo.fr/)). From networking bingo to graffiti canvas, we saw many people striking up conversations with strangers or having a great time with friends.

<img alt="People participating in a game jam" src="/storage/blog/godotcon24/one-pc-jam.webp"/>

One of the most popular activities turned out to be the One PC Jam (taking place at three laptops concurrently) where the conference attendees created a jam game over the course of two days. The twist: everyone only was granted one hour on the project, before having to concede their seat to the next person. This resulted in three separate, actually playable games, which you can [find on our GodotCon itch.io site](https://godotcon.itch.io/).

# Talks and workshops

The Godot community once again came through and submitted more interesting talks than we could fit on the program - resulting in us repurposing the admittedly rather small workshop room to squeeze some more of the talented speakers in. Luckily, we also invited a camera crew onsite, that took great care recording both the workshops and two talk tracks, for you to enjoy on the Godot Engine YouTube channel - some of them already available, the rest being edited as you read this blog post.
