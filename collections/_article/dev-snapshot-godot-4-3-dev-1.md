This was an exciting year for Godot! Our contributors managed to deliver massive, feature-packed releases 3 times over our previous norm. We can't wait to see and share what the international community of passionate game and game engine developers can create for you in the year 2024. Actually, they have already started their work on the upcoming Godot 4.3 release.

And it's holiday season, so we cannot leave you without a small gift as we wrap up the production and plan our leisure time. Please, enjoy the first dev snapshot of Godot 4.3, which includes quite a few noteworthy improvements for you to play with. It also contains a handful of fixes, including pretty much everything [published last week in Godot 4.2.1](/article/maintenance-release-godot-4-2-1/).

Here are the highlights of this build, and you can also go ahead and read a more complete list of changes [below](#whats-new):

- Major refactoring of the rendering system ([GH-83452](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/83452)), which paves the way to several big improvements coming soon ([here's one of them](/article/collaboration-with-google-forge-2023/)). In the meantime, please test anything and everything related to rendering. Even though this change has been rigorously evaluated by a multitude of experienced contributors, we, as always, rely on our community to make absolutely sure things are as smooth and stable as they seem.

- The new Direct3D 12 rendering driver is here for all your Microsoft-adjacent cross-platform needs ([GH-70315](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70315)). Being based on proprietary technology, D3D12 support comes as an optional feature keeping the open source spirit of the engine intact. Make sure to check the [updated documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/development/compiling/compiling_for_windows.html) for compiling Godot with D3D12 enabled (there is also an [update regarding cross-compilation](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/pull/8624) getting ready to be merged).

- Multiple controllers can now contribute to input actions ([GH-84943](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/84943)), which expands upon previous fixes to multiple devices triggering input at the same time.

- Profiler improvements for scripting ([GH-75623](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/75623)) and rendering ([GH-85811](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85811)).

- Node groups can now be configured project-wide ([GH-60965](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/60965)), with scenes correctly updating when you make the changes.

- Freed objects are now treated differently from null in comparison operators ([GH-73896](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/73896)), which ensures consistency for programmers when managing instances and memory.

- Loading of scenes with corrupted or missing dependencies will no longer be aborted ([GH-85159](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85159)), allowing you to use and fix such scenes without external tools.

- And finally, an infamous bug causing areas to lose signal connections when pausing/unpausing the game has been fixed ([GH-81809](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/81809)).

Keep in mind that while we try to make sure each dev snapshot is stable enough for general testing, this is by definition a pre-release piece of software. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also [try the **Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.3.dev1/) or the **Android editor** for this release.
