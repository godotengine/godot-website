Godot is the newest member of Software Freedom Conservancy!

Today we want to publicly announce that [Godot has joined Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2015/nov/04/godot-joins) as a member! Conservancy is now our non-profit corporate home.

Conservancy is a non-profit public charity that provides a home to its member projects that develop Free, Libre, and Open Source Software (FLOSS). Conservancy's assistance allows software developers and documenters to enjoy the benefits of nonprofit incorporation and expertise without having to independently undertake all of the effort to do it on their own. Joining Conservancy allows projects to collect donations, hold assets, and provide some liability protection for their lead developers' project-related activities. Software Freedom Conservancy, Inc. is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization, incorporated in New York State.

Ariel Manzur, core Godot developer, commented, “This is a huge step for us towards becoming a more open, rooted, and long lasting organization, to provide a more meaningful and robust contribution to the game development community, and software in general, and we're honored to have the support of Conservancy to achieve this.“

“We're thrilled to have Godot join Conservancy's projects,“ said Karen Sandler, Executive Director of Conservancy. “Games are an important part of the software ecosystem and freedom in this area is essential as they are often the first entry point for people to learn about software and how it works.“

As a result, we will soon be able to offer the possibility to ask for donations and get corporate sponsoring programs. Stay tuned!
