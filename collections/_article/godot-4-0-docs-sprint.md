With the release candidate for Godot Engine 4.0 being [just around the corner](/article/release-management-4-0-and-beyond), we want to make sure that the community is fully prepared and can dive right into it as soon as the new version is available. To that end, this is a call to action — to help in completing the documentation for Godot 4.

Everyone is welcome! New contributors, we're happy to help you get started. Seasoned participants, please take this chance to document all the awesome work you and your teammates have been doing on Godot. Helping each other is highly encouraged, filling the gaps and reviewing contributions to make sure they are factual and well written.

We have many new features, and documentation is going to be the first place people look at to figure them out. If you don't have a lot of time or lack writing skills, don't worry! The documentation team is happy to help out, just give us _something_ to work with be it a class reference addition or a new tutorial for the manual.

## How to participate in the docs sprint

- **What?** Calling on all members of the Godot community to help complete the docs for the next major release. We're happy to help, give tips, onboard new documentation contributors, and to get pull requests reviewed and merged! Let's get stuff done.

- **When?** Starting **right now** up until the end of this month, **January 31st**.

- **Who?** Everyone is welcome. Whether you're new to contributing, or returning to the project, there's enough to do for everyone.

- **How to start?** The [writing documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/documentation/) page in the documentation is a good start. If you have any questions, get in touch with the maintainers in the [#documentation](https://chat.godotengine.org/channel/documentation) channel on the Contributors Chat. You can see the whole documentation team on the [Teams page](https://godotengine.org/teams#documentation). If in doubt, ping **Max (@mhilbrunner)**.

- **Where to start?** Have a look at open issues in the [documentation repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/issues), as well as the [main repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adocumentation+milestone%3A4.0). You can also check the areas of the engine you're most familiar with. See if the class reference is [updated and complete](https://godotengine.github.io/doc-status/) for that area, whether the tutorials need to be updated, and so on.

- **Gotchas.** The **Class Reference** is maintained in the [main repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/master/doc/classes) and needs to be edited there. See [this article](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/documentation/updating_the_class_reference.html) for more information.

Thanks to everyone who contributes and helps make this project better for everyone. Let's end this announcement with a video by [Nathan of GDQuest fame](https://www.gdquest.com/) on how to start contributing to Godot's docs! [Watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jeHXxeX-JY).
