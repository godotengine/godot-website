We entered the beta phase for Godot 4.2 last week, with [4.2 beta 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-2-beta-1/). If you missed that release, have a look at the [release notes](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-2-beta-1/) for an overview of the key changes in Godot 4.2.

Since that first beta release, we fixed a number of bugs reported by the community, so we're now publishing a second beta snapshot to validate those improvements, and iterate closer to the release candidate stage.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also [try the **Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.2.beta2/) or the **Android editor** for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join [our testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds.

## Known issues

There are currently no known issues introduced by this release.

The previous beta 1 introduced a change to the mesh format which you might experience as some nagging warnings and slowdowns when opening a 3D project. To solve it, you need to resave all meshes to commit the changes ([GH-83287](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/83287)). We're working on improving that UX so it's done automatically ([GH-83613](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/83613)).

With every release we accept that there are going to be various issues, which have already been reported but haven't been fixed yet. See the GitHub issue tracker for a complete list of [known bugs](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+).

## Bug reports

As a tester, we encourage you to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in 4.2 beta 2).
