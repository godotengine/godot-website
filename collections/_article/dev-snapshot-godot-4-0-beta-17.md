We're now just days away from the Release Candidate, working at full capacity on finalizing as many of the remaining high priority issues as we can. The beta snapshots cadence allows us to better measure the overall stability and quickly catch regressions, especially when a lot of features are worked on at the same time.

This beta includes quite a few big changes which may interest a lot of users:

- Rework how current Camera2D is determined ([GH-65698](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/65698)).
- Implement audio blending feature to AnimationTree ([GH-72233](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72233)).
- Fix a couple dozen issues with GDScript typed arrays ([GH-69248](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/69248)), and a lot more GDScript fixes, check the list below.
- Refactor high quality texture import, enabling ASTC support ([GH-72031](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72031)).
- Add NavigationAgent path debug visualization ([GH-71543](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71543)).
- A bunch of rendering fixes, as usual!
- Fix several shader preprocessor include issues ([GH-72174](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72174)).

In the last few betas, as we tie up some loose ends, you may have noticed an increase in last minute [compatibility breaking changes](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2023-01-27T12%3A00..2023-02-01T12%3A00+is%3Amerged+sort%3Acreated-asc+milestone%3A4.0+label%3A%22breaks+compat%22). Those typically shouldn't add instability to the engine, but may require doing some changes in your scripts, scenes, and shaders if you were using the affected APIs. At this stage, we're trying to avoid unnecessary compat breakage, and focus on issues which cause user confusion and which can be solved with better naming or behavior of the APIs.

## What's new

If you're interested in an overview of what's new in Godot 4.0 beta in general, have a look at the detailed release notes for [4.0 beta 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-1). In this blog post, we will only cover the main changes since the previous beta release.

See the [**changelog on GitHub**](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/compare/518b9e5801a19229805fe837d7d0cf92920ad413...c40020513ac8201a449b5ae2eeb58fef0ce0a2a4), or the [**list of merged PRs**](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2023-01-27T12%3A00..2023-02-01T12%3A00+is%3Amerged+sort%3Acreated-asc+milestone%3A4.0), for an overview of all changes since 4.0 beta 16 (159 commits – excluding merge commits ― from 58 contributors).

While we do our best to minimize compatibility breaking changes for existing beta users, there are still occasional changes in the API which may impact your Godot 4 projects. See the list of PRs with the [`breaks compat` label](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2023-01-27T12%3A00..2023-02-01T12%3A00+is%3Amerged+sort%3Acreated-asc+milestone%3A4.0+label%3A%22breaks+compat%22) for details.

## Known issues

As we are still in the early beta phase of development, there are still many issues to fix, some of which have already been reported and are being worked on. See the GitHub issue tracker for a list of [known bugs in the 4.0 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.0+label%3Abug+).

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

As in any major release there are going to be compatibility breaking changes. However, we still try to provide a migration path for your projects. If you experience a regression without a known migration path or workaround, do not hesitate to report it.
