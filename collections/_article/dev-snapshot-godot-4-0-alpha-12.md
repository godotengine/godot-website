Another couple of weeks, another alpha snapshot from the development branch, this time with **4.0 alpha 12**! Same deal as usual, lots of bugs fixed and more refactoring and feature work. We're etching closer and closer to the beta stage, things are starting to fall into place!

Some noteworthy changes in this release:

- Grouping annotations for exported variables in GDScript (`@export_group`).
- Full support for Android scoped storage (also in 3.5 RCs).
- Font resource refactoring.
- Lots of GDScript 2.0 bugs squashed.

Be aware that during the alpha stage the engine is still not feature-complete or stable. **There will likely be breaking changes between this release and the first [*beta* release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta).** Only the beta will mark the so-called "feature freeze".

As such, we do not recommend porting existing projects to this and other upcoming alpha releases unless you are prepared to do it again to fix future incompatibilities. However, if you can port some existing projects and demos to the new version, that may provide a lot of useful information about critical issues still left to fix.

Most importantly: **Make backups before opening any existing project in Godot 4.0 alpha builds.** There is no easy way back once a project has been (partially) converted.
