Next week, we'll be attending our first [gamescom](https://www.gamescom.global) in Cologne, Germany. We'll be at the Godot booth in the Business Area, Hall 2.2, Stand C-042.

gamescom is a trade fair for video games held annually at the Koelnmesse in Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia. It is the world's largest gaming event (measured by exhibition space and number of visitors), with 370,000 visitors and 1037 exhibitors from 56 countries attending the show in 2018.

Thanks to [Ramatak](https://ramatak.com/) and [W4 Games](https://w4games.com/) who are donating it, the Godot Engine will have a booth. This is an excellent opportunity to meet us, and like-minded folks. Come hang out around the booth and get some free swag!
