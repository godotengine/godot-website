Next week, we'll be attending our first [gamescom](https://www.gamescom.global) in Cologne, Germany. We'll be at the Godot booth in the Business Area, Hall 2.2, Stand C-042.

Gamescom is a trade fair for video games held annually at the Koelnmesse in Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia. Gamescom is the world's largest gaming event (measured by exhibition space and number of visitors), with 370,000 visitors and 1037 exhibitors from 56 countries attending the show in 2018.

Thanks to [Ramatak](https://ramatak.com/) and [W4 Games](https://w4games.com/) who are donating it, the Godot Engine will have a booth. This is an excellent opportunity if you want to meet us, or other like-minded folks, so feel free to hang out and get some free swag ;)
