This is mainly of interest to the German members of our community, but maybe also German-speaking users of the neighbouring countries: Godot will be present as the [Kiel Open Source and Linux Days](http://www.kilux.de) (*Kieler Open Source und Linux Tage*, alias Kilux) in Kiel, Germany, on **Friday 15 and Saturday 16 September 2017**.

## Godot and OpenHMD (VR) stands

Several core Godot developers will be there (Andreas alias [Hinsbart](https://github.com/Hinsbart), [karroffel](https://github.com/karroffel) and [myself](https://github.com/akien-mga)), and we hope to see many other members of the community at our booth. If you plan to come to the event, don't hesitate to [add yourself to our Framadate](https://framadate.org/godot-kilux2017) so that we know whom to expect :)

We should also have some cool Godot T-Shirts on sale for a fair price!

But that's not all - we are teaming up with the [OpenHMD](http://www.openhmd.net) developers who will have their booth right next to ours. OpenHMD is a free and open source API and set of drivers for Virtual Reality (VR) devices, and they have been working with our main VR contributor [Bastiaan](https://github.com/BastiaanOlij) to implement their API in Godot 3.0.

This means that they will bring the VR devices, we will bring the ([work-in-progress](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/9545)) VR capable game engine, and together we will showcase demos of fully free and open source Virtual Reality! So by all means, come to our stands and give it a try!

## Godot talk and workshop

On Saturday 16, we will we have two organized events:
- A [general presentation](https://kielux.de/p319) of Godot from 11:00 to 12:00 in Room R114, intended mainly for people who haven't heard or read much about our engine yet. We will present features of both the current stable and the upcoming 3.0 versions, showcase some games, discuss the roadmap and answer all kinds of questions from the public.
- A [2-hour workshop to get started with Godot](https://kielux.de/p321) by making simple games together. At the time of this writing, there are only two places left, so be quick to secure yours! For those who may miss it, don't worry, we can spend plenty of time kickstarting your Godot journey directly at our stand :)

## Practical infos

The event takes place at the [Kieler Innovations- und Technologiezentrum](http://www.kilux.de/index.php?seite=besucher.html) in Kiel, Germany, from 10:00 to 18:00 both days. See the [visitor infos](http://www.kilux.de/index.php?seite=besucher.html) for more details, as well as the [programme](http://www.kilux.de/index.php?seite=programm.html) to plan ahead which talks and workshops you would like to attend. There is no entrance fee, as usual in such free software community events.

The event is mainly German-speaking, so all of us Godot developers are of course also English-speaking (some of us even being Dutch and French), so if you're in the geographical area, don't let the language barrier put you off. Our Godot presentation and workshop are planned in German for now, but if we see that the attendants would be like them in English, we can easily switch :)
