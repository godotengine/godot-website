Looking for a good chance to learn about Godot internals and development? Want to become a hero and help with the release of Godot 3.1? This is your chance!

Like every time we release an alpha, many issues [were tagged as "Hero Wanted"](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+milestone%3A3.1+sort%3Acreated-asc+label%3A%22hero+wanted%21%22) and include a description of how they could be fixed. You can take a stab at them and create a [pull request](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/community/contributing/pr_workflow.html) with the fix.

Don't know how to set up a development environment? Here are guides for compiling Godot on [Windows](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/development/compiling/compiling_for_windows.html), [Desktop Linux](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/development/compiling/compiling_for_x11.html) and [OSX](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/development/compiling/compiling_for_osx.html). You will most likely need an IDE for editing code, which can be [Qt Creator](https://www1.qt.io/offline-installers/) (Scroll down for the stand-alone installer) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Guides on setting up the IDE can be found [here](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/development/cpp/configuring_an_ide.html).



If you feel this is too easy for you and want a bigger challenge, you can help other contributors [with their issues](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/21855).

Good Luck!
