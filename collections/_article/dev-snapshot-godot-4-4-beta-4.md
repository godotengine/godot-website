We knew from the beginning that aiming for a late-February release was an ambitious timeframe, but the community has risen to the challenge and kept development right on track! As such, you can expect this to be our final beta release of the 4.4 period, with release candidates set to come out shortly after. In practice, this means that all further changes will be *strictly* regression fixes, so the content available here will be largely reflective of the 4.4 release. As always, users are strongly encouraged to test this snapshot to catch the remaining few release blockers.

Please, consider [supporting the project financially](#support), if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors.

## Known issues

During the beta stage, we focus on solving both regressions (i.e. something that worked in a previous release is now broken) and significant new bugs introduced by new features. You can have a look at our current [list of regressions and significant issues](https://github.com/orgs/godotengine/projects/61) which we aim to address before releasing 4.4. This list is dynamic and will be updated if we discover new showstopping issues after more users start testing the beta snapshots.

With every release, we accept that there are going to be various issues which have already been reported but haven't been fixed yet. See the GitHub issue tracker for a complete list of [known bugs](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+).

- Changes to scenes are not reflected in APK exports after the initial export in the Android editor. The issue is tracked in [GH-101007](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/101007).

## Bug reports

As a tester, we encourage you to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in this snapshot).
