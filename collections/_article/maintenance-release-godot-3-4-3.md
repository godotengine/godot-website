In parallel to our work on the upcoming feature releases Godot 3.5 ([with a first beta](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-3-5-beta-1)) and 4.0 ([now at alpha 3!](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-alpha-3)), we backport important fixes to the stable 3.4 branch for use in production.

A number of such fixes have been queued in the two months since the [3.4.2 release](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-4-2), and we after a couple of Release Candidates (thanks to all testers!), we're now ready to release **Godot 3.4.3-stable** as a maintenance update to the current stable branch.

## Known incompatibilities

Some regressions have been found in the 3.4.3 version after its release, which may affect your project:

- Rendering issues for both GLES2 and GLES3 with 3D meshes using blend shapes and octahedral compression ([GH-58789](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/58789)).
- HTTPRequest CORS header error on HTML5 ([GH-58615](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/58615)).
- PitchShift audio bus effect cannot be dynamically changed ([GH-58647](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/58647)).

These issues are fixed in [Godot 3.4.4](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-4-4).
