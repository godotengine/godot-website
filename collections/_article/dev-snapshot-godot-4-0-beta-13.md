With the first Godot 4.0 Release Candidate on the horizon we continue to release beta snapshots frequently and relentlessly! Such cadence allows us to better measure the overall stability and quickly catch regressions, especially when a lot of features are worked on at the same time.

This week we release a new batch of improvements and fixes, as well as some new features. Unfortunately, we also have to rollback one of the core animations features. After a lot of testing and consideration we've decided to postpone improvements to the inverse kinematics system until a future Godot 4.x release, removing the currently unstable `SkeletonModificationStack3D`. This decision allows us to better focus efforts of the Animation team on stabilizing other features.

This beta includes a few big changes which may interest a lot of users:

- `SkeletonModificationStack3D` has been removed, with the 3D inverse kinematic API being more or less reset to the state of Godot 3.x. We will focus on fixing regressions in `SkeletonIK3D` for the remaining time, and work has already started on an improved IK system for a future Godot 4.x version ([GH-71137](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71137)).

- You can now deploy your projects to all desktop platforms over SSH, as well as run a remote debug session similar to what we already offered for Android and Web. This is especially useful for the developers targeting the Steam Deck, as you can configure it to have one-click deploy to your device. As the number of remote debug options is quite big by now, we've packed them neatly in a single drop-down menu ([GH-63312](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/63312), [GH-70701](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70701)).

- Several breaking changes were made to the C# API to bring it closer to the engine core and make it more consistent overall ([GH-71445](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71445), [GH-71458](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71458), [GH-71423](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71423), [GH-71431](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71431), [GH-71424](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71424), [GH-71456](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71456)). There's been a number of documentation improvements related to C# too, as a part of our [ongoing documentation sprint](/article/godot-4-0-docs-sprint/).

- Methods for drawing 2D lines and primitive shapes that take width as a parameter have been fixed and can now correctly handle widths at `1.0` or below ([GH-69851](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/69851)).

- The list of all global script classes (and their icons) is no longer stored in the `project.godot` file. It is now saved to a dedicated file inside of the `.godot` folder ([GH-70557](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70557)). This should improve VCS diffs for your projects.
  - **Note:** If you're exporting your project from the command line and don't have the `.godot` folder available, you currently need to make sure to run the editor at least once (in the headless mode) before trying to export it, similarly to what is required to import resources. [This is a bug](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/69511) and should be solved eventually (so that you can `--export-debug` or `--export-release` directly from a Git checkout without `.godot` folder).

You can also [try the Web editor](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.0.beta13/godot.editor.html) (early testing, it's still slow and unstable).

## What's new

If you're interested in an overview of what's new in Godot 4.0 beta in general, have a look at the detailed release notes for [4.0 beta 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-1). In this blog post, we will only cover the main changes since the previous beta release.

See the [**changelog on GitHub**](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/compare/3c9bf4bc210a8e6a208f30ca59de4d4d7e18c04d...caacade569eb7a541aaa7a8cdc3eedffca1422d9), or the [**list of merged PRs**](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2023-01-13T10%3A00..2023-01-17T13%3A00+is%3Amerged+sort%3Acreated-asc+milestone%3A4.0), for an overview of all changes since 4.0 beta 12 (88 commits – excluding merge commits ― from 39 contributors).

While we do our best to minimize compatibility breaking changes for existing beta users, there are still occasional changes in the API which may impact your Godot 4 projects. See the list of PRs with the [`breaks compat` label](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2023-01-13T10%3A00..2023-01-17T13%3A00+is%3Amerged+sort%3Acreated-asc+milestone%3A4.0+label%3A%22breaks+compat%22) for details.

## Known issues

As we are still in the early beta phase of development, there are still many issues to fix, some of which have already been reported and are being worked on. See the GitHub issue tracker for a list of [known bugs in the 4.0 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.0+label%3Abug+).

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

As in any major release there are going to be compatibility breaking changes. However, we still try to provide a migration path for your projects. If you experience a regression without a known migration path or workaround, do not hesitate to report it.
