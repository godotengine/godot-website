## Connecting your accounts

### Forum Badge

The forum badges are assigned automatically to your Godot account when you become a fund member.

Already a fund member but your badge does not show up? Make sure that you have signed in at least once to the [development fund](https://fund.godotengine.org/#membership). It may take up to 24 hours for the badge to appear on the forum.

## Not ready to become a member yet?

While this won't give you a fancy badge or role, we have recently added the option for one-time donations to our fund. With this update, we also switched to Stripe as our payment provider to offer the option to donate via credit card in addition to PayPal.

Thank you for supporting Godot!
