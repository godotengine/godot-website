Season's greetings, everyone! As our team winds down for the holiday season, we present you with one last gift before
the new year: our final development build of the year!

After having a few notable regressions in dev 6, we intended to do a quick turnaround for dev 7 with high priority bug
fixes. But we got greedy and ended up making dev 7 another feature-packed new release so you will have plenty of things
to check out while we are on holidays.

Keep in mind that while we try to make sure each dev snapshot is stable enough for general testing, this is by
definition a pre-release piece of software. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a version control system such as
Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also try the [**Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.4.dev7/), [**XR editor**](https://www.meta.com/experiences/godot-game-engine/7713660705416473/), or the **Android editor** for this release (join the [Android editor testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds).

## Highlights

In case you missed them, see the [4.4 dev 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-1/), [4.4 dev 2](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-2/),
[4.4 dev 3](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-3/), [4.4 dev 4](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-4/), [4.4 dev 5](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-5/), and [4.4 dev 6](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-6/) release notes for an overview of
some key features which were already in those snapshots, and are therefore still available for testing in dev 7.

Here are highlights of a few new features in dev 7 that you might find particularly exciting!

### Jolt Physics Module

Ever since its inception in late 2022, [godot-jolt](https://github.com/godot-jolt/godot-jolt) has become the de-facto 3D
physics engine for many of our developers. Much of the history behind why this was the case is documented in [this
proposal](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/7308) by [Adam Scott](https://github.com/adamscott), but
the main takeaway was a strong push for this tool to be recognized as an official addon. In doing so, users would be
able to find this amazing resource in a way that was promoted by the engine itself; an exciting prospect!

The Godot Jolt maintainers, [Mikael Hermansson](https://github.com/mihe) and [Jorrit Rouwe](https://github.com/jrouwe),
took this idea one step further: integrating the tool as part of the engine *directly*. There was already a symbiosis
between their team and the godot engine, with many features being added to Godot *and* Jolt to accommodate both, but the
integration of an official module was no small feat; their pull request
([GH-99895](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99895)) ended up adding over 500 files and 115 **thousand** lines
of code! So while this was one of the most rigorously tested PRs relative to the amount of time it's been up, it'd be
impossible for any team to account for *everything* this behemoth introduced, so we eagerly await your feedback (and bug
reports) on one of the most highly-requested features of 4.x.

**NOTE:** At time of writing, this does **not** replace Godot Physics as the default 3D physics engine. This is because
Jolt Physics have yet to reach full feature-parity with Godot Physics. If your interests/use-case are supported, the
tool can be enabled by changing the `physics/3d/physics_engine` project setting to `Jolt Physics`.

### .NET 8.0

[Paul Joannon](https://github.com/paulloz) and [Raul Santos](https://github.com/raulsntos) have put the final pieces in
place for supporting .Net 8 in Godot projects ([GH-92131](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92131) and
[GH-100195](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/100195)). New projects will automatically use .Net 8 and there is
an upgrade system in place for existing projects that want to upgrade as well. 

### Improved Scene Tree editor performance

The amount of performance boosts that've been crammed in between dev 6 and dev 7 has been staggering. Of note are the
recent improvements to the engine's core including a many optimizes throughout the String class, spearheaded by
[Ivorforce](https://github.com/Ivorforce). But perhaps the most obvious improvement comes from [HP van
Braam](https://github.com/hpvb) and their modifications to the SceneTree system
([GH-99700](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99700)). While this will prove beneficial across all projects,
these changes result in especially complex scenes having a tenfold performance in the editor when moving or renaming
nodes in the SceneTree.

### Documentation tooltips

Thanks to [Danil Alexeev](https://github.com/dalexeev) the GDScript code editor will now display a tooltip containing
information about functions, variables, classes, etc. when you hover over them, including the documentation you have
written using our documentation system ([GH-91060](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/91060)). This makes using
the integrated documentation system even more powerful as you no longer have to bounce between the code editor and the
related docs to quickly get information.

### Baked Shadowmasks for Lightmaps

Until now, you have always had to choose between fully baked or fully dynamic shadows when using LightmapGI. However,
sometimes you want to have dynamic shadows up close where detail matters, but use static shadows in the distance where a
low resolution is acceptable. Finally it is possible thanks the the hard work of
[BlueCube3310](https://github.com/BlueCube3310) in [GH-85653](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85653). You can
now enable shadow masks while baking your LightmapGI to combine dynamic and static shadows for the best quality. 

Additionally, this allows you to drastically shorten the range of your dynamic shadows which is a very important
optimization, especially for mobile devices.

This feature is still experimental and it will change in response to feedback, so please test it out and let us know
what you think!
