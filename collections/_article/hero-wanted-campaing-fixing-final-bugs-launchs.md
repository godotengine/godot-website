We are all working hard on fixing the remaining issues for delivering a stable Godot 3.0 as soon as possible, but we
definitely need a hand to speed up the work!

Because of this, we are re-launching the Hero Wanted campaign, this time it's the ultimate battle!

### Hero Wanted (v2)

While most issues require more experience with the codebase, we have marked a [good amount of issues](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22hero+wanted%21%22) with the "Hero Wanted!" tag. They include a description on how the problem can be approached, so it's great for new contributors unfamiliar with the code.

Feel free to join irc (#godotengine-devel) if you need assistance from other devs. We are counting on you!
