In parallel to our work on Godot 3.5 ([with a first beta](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-3-5-beta-1)) and 4.0 ([and finally alpha 1!](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-alpha-1)), we backport important fixes to the stable 3.4 branch for use in production.

A number of such fixes have been queued since the [3.4.2 release](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-4-2), so we're getting ready to release Godot 3.4.3, and this first [Release Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate) is your chance to help us validate it.

As usual, you can try it live with the [**online version of the Godot editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/3.4.3.rc1/) updated for this release.<br />
**Edit:** Or not, there's a regression for the web editor in this build ([GH-57592](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/57592)). This will be fixed in the next build.
