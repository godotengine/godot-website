Two weeks ago we have published the biggest release in the history of Godot — [Godot 4.0](/article/godot-4-0-sets-sail). It marked the beginning of a new journey for the engine and its users, like yourself. And as is the case with every new beginning, some problems have been reported, some points of frictions have been identified, and so fixes and improvements are in order.

For the time being we are primarily focusing on changes that address critical issues (such as crashes and regressions), as well as small self-contained fixes to various parts of the engine and documentation improvements. This allows us to publish this patch release quickly and with a lot of confidence that it doesn't introduce new problems and regressions in the process. As such, we are starting directly with a [Release Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate).

Please give it a try if you can. It should be safe to migrate your existing projects to 4.0.1, but to make sure of that we need your help testing the changes. If there are no significant regressions reported with release candidates, a stable version is going to be published soon. Don't forget to always make backups when moving versions, even minor. Better yet, prefer using a version control system, such as Git, and commit a version of your project before the migration.

## Highlights

This release candidate includes some changes which may interest a lot of users:

- Multiple conditions for crashes and freezes have been addressed throughout the editor and the engine.

- The project converter has been improved with new renames and corrections to its behavior around various scripting statements.

- Numerous improvements to the documentation and translations.
