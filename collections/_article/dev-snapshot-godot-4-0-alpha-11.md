Another couple of weeks, another alpha snapshot from the development branch, this time with **4.0 alpha 11**! Same deal as usual, lots of bugs fixed and more refactoring and feature work. We're etching closer and closer to the beta stage, things are starting to fall into place!

Some noteworthy changes in this release:
- Exporting Node pointers as NodePaths (`@export var some_node: Node`)
- Movie Maker run mode to record in-game footage for trailers/movies
- Fix GDScript bug causing return values to be reset in release builds
- AnimationTree advance expressions to drive complex state machines

**Note:** There was a change in the internal format that PNG files get imported to, which you might experience as projects from earlier alphas reporting broken dependencies. You can fix this by deleting the `.godot/imported/` folder to force a reimport. (Or manually triggering a reimport for your image resources.)

Be aware that during the alpha stage the engine is still not feature-complete or stable. **There will likely be breaking changes between this release and the first [*beta* release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta).** Only the beta will mark the so-called "feature freeze".

As such, we do not recommend porting existing projects to this and other upcoming alpha releases unless you are prepared to do it again to fix future incompatibilities. However, if you can port some existing projects and demos to the new version, that may provide a lot of useful information about critical issues still left to fix.

Most importantly: **Make backups before opening any existing project in Godot 4.0 alpha builds.** There is no easy way back once a project has been (partially) converted.
