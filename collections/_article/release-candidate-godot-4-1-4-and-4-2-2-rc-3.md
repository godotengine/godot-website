Here's the final round of release candidates for Godot 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, which I aim to release as stable in a few days.

The previous [RC 2 builds](/article/release-candidate-godot-4-1-4-and-4-2-2-rc-2/) were already fairly solid, but [GDC 2024](/article/gdc-2024-retrospective/) and Easter holidays delayed the stable release a bit. And since a few more important bug fixes were merged in the meantime, I decided to do a final batch of cherry-picks and thus a third release candidate to validate them.

These builds should be exactly what the stable release would be, so please give them a try with your current projects (and maybe give 4.2.2 RC 3 a spin during this weekend's [Ludum Dare 55](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/55) ;)). I won't wait too long this time to release the stable builds, so I need any potential regression to be reported in the coming days.

Maintenance releases are expected to be safe for an upgrade, but we recommend to always make backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give the new releases a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements. You can also try the **Web editor** ([**4.1.4 RC 3**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.1.4.rc3/), [**4.2.2 RC 3**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.2.2.rc3/)) or the **Android editor** for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join [our testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds.
