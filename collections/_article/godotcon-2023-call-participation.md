We are organizing the annual Godot Conference that will happen [live in Munich](/article/godotcon-2023/) on November 4th and 5th 2023 for the 
first time since [our last conference in 2020](/article/meet-community-fosdem-and-godotcon-2020/). We are really thrilled to meet fellow Godot users and developers again and to share experiences during the two days of the event.

## Call for speakers & workshop

We would like to include all kinds of presentations during the event, and we need you for this! If you are interested in 
sharing your project or experience that could interest Godot users, feel free to propose a dedicated talk or workshop on [our dedicated platform](https://events.godotengine.org/conferences/godotcon2023/program/proposals/new).

We are opening 2 tracks: 

* Main track
* Workshops

Please note that depending on the number of proposals we receive and the number of available slots, we may have to reject some proposals. Do not feel left out! You may propose again next year.

### Main track

This track is open to talks for various topics. We would like to see anything Godot-related or even not directly related to Godot but still relevant for game or engine developers.

This track lasts the two whole days of the event. We propose two talk durations: **30 minutes or 60 minutes (each including 5-10 min Q&A)**, though if you need a different duration, you may express your needs in your proposal. When possible, we will change your talk duration accordingly.

Here are a few examples from last year's online GodotCon event:

* WebXR in Godot
* (Almost) A Year of Fam Jams
* Teaching Godot Engine: Learning Experience Design
* Wwise Godot Integration: integrating audio middleware into Godot
* The Garden Path
* The new rendering of Godot 4.0
* Extending the 2D Renderer: Adding 3D-Like Shadowing


### Workshops

This year we will provide a room specifically for workshops on both mornings of the event (on afternoons the room will be accessible for everyone to hack around). We may then dedicate from two to four slots (depending on their duration) for workshops. Ideally, a workshop may last from one to two hours, but if you think more time is needed for your proposal, please indicate how much longer it needs to be and why.


## Call for volunteers

A great event cannot happen without great staff to help us manage some tasks during the event:

* Steward Lead
* Stewards/General Volunteers
* Hosts (for speakers/sponsors)
* IT Lead
* IT Technicians
* Streaming Lead
* Streaming Operators & Moderators
* Ticketing & Accreditation Lead
* Ticketing & Accreditation
* Meet 2 Match Host

But we are not limited to these roles! If you think you can contribute, please do reach out.
  
We understand volunteers may be interested in participating in the event as well. Therefore, volunteer duties will not last all event long - unless you expressively tell us so.

If you are interested in one of the above roles, please send us an email at [godotcon@proton.me](mailto:godotcon@proton.me?subject=Volunteering Inquiry) or join the [GodotCon 2023 Discord server](https://discord.gg/Qrj28UMQPj).


# Sponsoring 

To enable an event for about 300 participants and to keep ticket prices low, we have to gather some external funds, mainly for the venue, security, catering, documentation, swag, speaker support, etc. Therefore we are still looking for new sponsors to help us make it happen.

As a sponsor you have a distinctive chance to support this conference, which offers a remarkable developer relations and marketing opportunity. This opportunity comes with the added advantage of relatively low investment. If you wish to sponsor this event, please send us an email at [contact@godotengine.org](mailto:contact@godotengine.org?subject=Sponsorship Inquiry) and provide some detail on how or what you would like to sponsor. For more information, please have a look at our [Sponsorship Page](https://galvanized-slope-59b.notion.site/Public-GodotCon-Sponsorship-Page-acd1185de6594982943682caf4840d67).

We would like to address a big thank you to our current sponsors without whom this event would not be possible:
