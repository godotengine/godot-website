[Godot 3.4.3 was released less than 3 weeks ago](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-4-3), but a few significant regressions were found in that release, so we're fast-tracking the release of Godot 3.4.4 to solve those.

This [Release Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate) adds a handful of fixes, including several regression fixes. Please make sure to test it on your projects and to report any issue, so that we can release 3.4.4 stable in the coming days.

As usual, you can try it live with the [**online version of the Godot editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/3.4.4.rc2/) updated for this release.

- CSG: Fix mixed smoothed and non-smoothed face normals computation for CSG shapes ([GH-59039](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/59039)).

- HTML5: Revert "[HTML5] Fetch API now passes credentials." ([GH-58862](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/58862)) **[regression fix]**.
  * This turned out not to be a good option with the current state of the web standard.

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with 3.4.4 RC 2. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in earlier 3.4.x releases no longer works in 3.4.4 RC 2).
