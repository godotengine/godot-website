While most of our development focus is on the [upcoming Godot 4.1](/article/release-management-4-1/), and maintenance releases for the stable 4.0 branch (with [4.0.3 published last week](/article/maintenance-release-godot-4-0-3/)), a handful of dedicated contributors still work as time permits on finalizing the 3.6 release, to bring important fixes and some welcome new features to users who prefer not to port their projects to Godot 4.

We had a first [3.6 beta 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-3-6-beta-1/) build a month ago, and it's time for the second one. We've only merged around 50 changes since beta 1, but some of those are pretty substantial and have long been in development, so there's a lot to test!

A lot of work is also being done to improve the Android editor port. We're looking for interested users to help test the beta snapshots via Google Play, and provide us with feedback and automated reports on potential issues.

It's available on [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/murtop-switch/), [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2148170/Murtop/), and [itch.io](https://hiulit.itch.io/murtop).*
