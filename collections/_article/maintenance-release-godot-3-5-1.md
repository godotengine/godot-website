We released [Godot 3.5](/article/godot-3-5-cant-stop-wont-stop) in early August, and like any release, there are few rough edges to iron out which warrant making maintenance "patch" releases (3.5.x). Such maintenance releases focus on fixing bugs and not on integrating new features. This helps guarantee that the overall production readiness of the stable branch keeps increasing.

So this 3.5.1 release fixes a number of regressions that users reported after the release, as well as various other fixes to pre-existing bugs and usability improvements.

**This is a safe and recommended update for all Godot 3.5.x users.** It should have no major incidence on your projects, even complex ones in production, if you're already using 3.5-stable.
