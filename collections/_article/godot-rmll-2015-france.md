## Godot at RMLL 2015

Juan Linietsky, one of the main developers of Godot Engine will be giving a talk and a workshop about Godot Engine at RMLL 2015. As most of them reside in South America, this is a great opportunity for Europeans to learn about Godot, meet the developers and have the chance to go out for beers!

RMLL takes place in Beauvais, a city a little north of Paris, from July 4 to July 10.

The schedule will be:

* **Tuesday 7 July, 15:20**: Introduction to Godot Engine (talk)
*Edit:* The video recording of the talk can be [viewed online](http://video.rmll.info/videos/introduction-au-moteur-godot/).

* The time and date of the workshop is TBA but should be the same or the next day.
More information at the [RMLL website](https://2015.rmll.info).

Thanks enormously to the organization of RMLL for this invitation!

## Godot in Paris

Juan will be having meetings in Paris the week from the 10 to the 17, so if you want to schedule a meeting with him (or just want to go out for beers), please contact him beforehand!

## Spread the love!

We are also working hard so everyone willing to give a talk in their local community can have access to the materials we use in our talks and workshops (please help us translate them to your native language!).
