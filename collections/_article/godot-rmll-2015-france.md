## Godot at RMLL 2015

Juan Linietsky, one of the main developers of Godot Engine will be giving a talk and a workshop about Godot Engine at RMLL 2015. As most of them reside in South America, this is a great opportunity for Europeans to learn about Godot, meet the developers and have the chance to go out for beers!

RMLL takes place in Beauvais, a city a little north of Paris, from July 4 to July 10.

The schedule will be:

* **Tuesday 7 July, 15:20**: Introduction to Godot Engine (talk)  
*Edit:* The video recording of the talk can be [viewed online](http://video.rmll.info/videos/introduction-au-moteur-godot/).

* The time and date of the workshop is TBA but should be the same or the next day.  
More information at the [RMLL website](https://2015.rmll.info).

Thanks enormously to the organization of RMLL for this invitation!
