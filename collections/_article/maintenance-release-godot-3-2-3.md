Godot contributors are proud to release **Godot 3.2.3** as a maintenance update to the stable `3.2` branch. The main development focus for this version was to fix regressions reported against the fairly big [3.2.2 release](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-2-2) from June, but in the process many other bugfixes for older issues have been merged.

There's one big change for C# users though, which is that the `.csproj` project definition now uses a more modern format relying on a new `Godot.NET.Sdk`, which should help solve many build issues. This also enables changing the target .NET framework: by default, it is still .NET Framework 4.7.2, but it can be changed manually to .NET Standard 2.0 or greater.

[**Download Godot 3.2.3**](/download) now and read on about the changes in this update.

## Changes

Godot 3.2.3 includes over 500 commits from ca. 100 contributors. There were fixes all around the engine to address regressions, backport new fixes from the `master` branch, as well as a wide array of usability enhancements and documentation improvements.

Consult the complete changelog ([sorted by authors](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2.3/Godot_v3.2.3-stable_changelog_authors.txt) or by [reverse chronological order](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2.3/Godot_v3.2.3-stable_changelog_chrono.txt)) for an exhaustive list of all changes.

Here's a hand-picked list of the some of the main changes in Godot 3.2.3:

- Android: Fix Return key events in LineEdit & TextEdit on Android ([GH-40469](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/40469)).
- Android: Add option to enable high precision float in GLES2 ([GH-33646](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/33646)).
- C#: New `csproj` style with backport of Godot.NET.Sdk ([GH-41408](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/41408)).
  * Note: This change breaks forward compatibility, C# projects opened in 3.2.3 will no longer work with 3.2.2 or earlier. Backup your project files before upgrading.
  * Additionally, this change seems to cause issues when using Mono's MSBuild on Windows. See "known incompatibility" below for advice on what build tool to use instead.
- C#: Add Visual Studio support ([GH-39784](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/39784)).
  * Note: At the time of this release, there's a [known issue](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-csharp-visualstudio/issues/10) with the Visual Studio C# add-in. It should be fixed soon via a new release of the add-in.

- HTML5: Improvements and bugfixes backported from the `master` branch ([GH-39604](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/39604)).
  * Note: This PR adds threads support, but as this support is still [disabled in many browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=sharedarraybuffer) due to security concerns, the option is not enabled by default. Build HTML5 templates with `threads_enabled=yes` to test it.

  * Note: This makes the behavior of the GodotPhysics and Bullet backends consistent, and more user-friendly with Bullet. If you're using damping with the Bullet backend, you may need to adjust some properties to restore the behavior from 3.2.2 or earlier (see [GH-42051](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/42051#issuecomment-692132877)).

- Rendering: Allow nearest neighbor lookup when using mipmaps ([GH-40523](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/40523)).
- Rendering: Properly calculate Polygon2D AABB with skeleton ([GH-40869](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/40869)).
- RichTextLabel: Fix RichTextLabel fill alignment regression ([GH-40081](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/40081)) [regression fix].
- RichTextLabel: Fix `center` alignment bug ([GH-40892](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/40892)).
- Script editor: Don't open dominant script in external editor ([GH-40735](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/40735)).
- Shaders: Fix specular `render_mode` for Visual Shaders ([GH-41536](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/41536)).
- Sprite3D: Use mesh instead of immediate for drawing Sprite3D ([GH-39867](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/39867)).

- SkeletonIK: Fix calling `reload_goal()` when starting IK with `start(true)` ([GH-40768](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/40768)).
- TileSet: Fix potential crash when editing polygons ([GH-40560](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/40560)).
- Tree: Fix crash when hovering columns after removing a column ([GH-41876](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/41876)) [regression fix].
- Windows: DirectInput: Use correct joypad ID ([GH-40927](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/40927)).
- Thirdparty library updates (mbedtls 2.16.8, stb_vorbis 1.20, wslay 1.1.1).
- API documentation updates.
- Editor translation updates.
- And many more bug fixes and usability enhancements all around the engine!

## Known incompatibilities

While we strive to preserve compatibility in the 3.2 branch, there's a lot of surface covered in a game engine and some bug fixes might have an impact on your projects if you somehow used a bug as a feature. Here's a list of known incompatibilities / changes that you might need to be aware of:

- C#: The new `.csproj` format is not compatible with earlier Godot releases. When you open your project in Godot 3.2.3, a backup of the old project file should be made with the extension `.csproj.old`. Rename it to `.csproj` if you need to roll-back to 3.2.2 for some reason.
- C#: Mono's MSBuild version seems to pose problems with the new `.csproj` format on Windows. If you have issues building your project after the upgrade, please try to select a different build tool in Editor Settings > Mono > Builds. The recommended build tools are "MSBuild (Visual Studio)" (installed with Visual Studio 2019) and "dotnet CLI" (installed with [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/visual-studio-sdks)).
- Input: The improvements made to better support modern SDL2 gamepad mappings may introduce regressions in the detection of some specific models. If you notice any mapping issue, [please file a bug report](github.com/godotengine/godot/issues).
- Physics: The fixes to the damping implementation for Bullet physics may impact how your 3D physics behave, if you relied on that feature. See [GH-42051](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/42051#issuecomment-692132877) for advice on how to change your damping values to reproduce the pre-3.2.3 behavior.
- Sprite3D: The ``material_override`` now overrides the ``texture`` when drawing. So when using a ``material_override`` you will have to set the ``Sprite3D``'s ``texture`` and the ``albedo_texture`` to the same texture.

If you upgrade from 3.2 or 3.2.1, be sure to also check the [changes from 3.2.2](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-2-2) which might impact your project.

If you experience any unexpected behavior change in your projects after upgrading from a previous version to 3.2.3, please [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues).
