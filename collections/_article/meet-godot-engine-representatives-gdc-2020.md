Next month it will be time for GDC yet again! The project leadership will be attending the event for meetings and we are starting to build our schedule for GDC 2020.

If you would like to meet with us, please let us know (write to *contact at godotengine Â· org*) so we can reserve a slot for you for meeting, go for lunch, dinner or a coffee!

It is not certain this year whether there will be official Godot activities during GDC as we did not have a lot of time to organize so, if you want to meet with us, it is recommended you just contact us directly.

Of course, if we end up organizing an event in the end, we will post about it as soon as possible.

For those who can go, see you there!
