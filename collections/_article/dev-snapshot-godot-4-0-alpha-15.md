We're working towards finalizing the feature set for 4.0 beta, reviewing many PRs which have been opened prior to our roadmap [feature freeze](/article/godot-4-0-development-enters-feature-freeze) announced a month ago. While this process is ongoing, we'll keep releasing alpha builds so here's **4.0 alpha 15**! Same deal as usual, lots of bugs fixed and more refactoring and feature work.

Some noteworthy changes in this release:

- C#: Merged .NET 6 support ([GH-64089](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/64089)).
  * This alpha doesn't include official builds with .NET 6 support yet, as we still have more work to do to enable this. For now, it's possible to compile it yourself from source, see [`modules/mono/README.md`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/modules/mono/README.md) for instructions.
- Editor: Add per-scene UndoRedo ([GH-59564](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/59564)).
- Animation: Complete implementation of [Animation Retargeting](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/4510)!
- Rendering: Octahedral normal/tangent compression ([GH-60309](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/60309)).
- Core: A plethora of renames!
  * The beta feature freeze will soon lock the API more or less in place, so contributors have been hard at work evaluating and merging or rejecting the last proposals for a more consistent and user-friendly API.
  * For users of previous alphas, we don't always have compatibility code to ease transition. If you run into upgrade issues that you can't solve easily, please let us know so we can consider how much inter-alpha compatibility code we need to add.

Be aware that during the alpha stage the engine is still not feature-complete or stable. **There will likely be breaking changes between this release and the first [*beta* release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta).** Only the beta will mark the so-called "feature freeze".

As such, we do not recommend porting existing projects to this and other upcoming alpha releases unless you are prepared to do it again to fix future incompatibilities. However, if you can port some existing projects and demos to the new version, that may provide a lot of useful information about critical issues still left to fix.

Most importantly: **Make backups before opening any existing project in Godot 4.0 alpha builds.** There is no easy way back once a project has been (partially) converted.

This release is built from commit [432b25d36](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/432b25d3649319517827dbf7bc275e81e0a2b92e).

## Downloads

The downloads for this dev snapshot can be found directly on our repository:

* [Standard build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.0/alpha15/) (GDScript, GDExtension).
* .NET 6 support should be included in 4.0 beta 1. The initial support has been merged, but more work is required to make official builds easily. For now, it's possible to compile it yourself from source, see [`modules/mono/README.md`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/modules/mono/README.md) for instructions.

## Known issues

As we are still in the alpha phase of development, there are still many issues to fix, some of which have already been reported and are being worked on.

See the GitHub issue tracker for a list of [known bugs in the 4.0 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.0+label%3Abug+).

In this build specifically, we mistakenly compiled only the `arm64v8` libraries for the Android templates and editor builds. That's why the whole templates package ended up significantly smaller, and Android exports would not work on `armv7`, `x86` and `x86_64` architectures.

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with 4.0 alpha 15. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

As in any major release there are going to be compatibility breaking changes. However, we still try to provide a migration path for your projects. If you experience a regression without a known migration path or workaround, do not hesitate to report it.

## Support
