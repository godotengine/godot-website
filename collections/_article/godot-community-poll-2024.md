We want to learn more about the Godot community, understand who the users of the engine are, and find out how we can better support you. We have a short list of questions and hope you will take a few minutes to fill them out.

The poll is anonymous, and we will share the results publicly once submissions are closed. It will remain open for a week and should take only 5-10 minutes to complete.
