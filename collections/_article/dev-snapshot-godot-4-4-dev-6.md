Safety goggles on, people! Features and Quality-of-Life are being integrated at blinding speeds; precautions must be taken to view them head-on. Once secure, we can dive into what's shaping up to be one of the final development snapshots before 4.4-beta builds roll out!

Keep in mind that while we try to make sure each dev snapshot is stable enough for general testing, this is by
definition a pre-release piece of software. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a version control system such as
Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also try the [**Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.4.dev6/), [**XR editor**](https://www.meta.com/experiences/godot-game-engine/7713660705416473/), or the **Android editor** for this release (join the [Android editor testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds).

## Highlights

In case you missed them, see the [4.4 dev 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-1/), [4.4 dev 2](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-2/),
[4.4 dev 3](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-3/), [4.4 dev 4](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-4/), and [4.4 dev 5](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-5/) release notes for an overview of
some key features which were already in those snapshots, and are therefore still available for testing in dev 6.

Here are highlights of a few new features in dev 6 that you might find particularly exciting!

### Camera3D preview in inspector

Previously, adjusting the view of a `Camera3D` in a scene could be a chore to handle. It required activating the camera you wanted to preview, and then reverting it back if it wasn't the main camera. You could pin a preview of a camera in a dedicated viewport, but that meant reducing the real-estate of your main viewport.

Now, with [Haoyu Qiu](https://github.com/timothyqiu)'s feature ([GH-90778](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/90778)), every selected 3D camera shows a preview inside the inspector. No switching cameras needed to preview anymore.

### CollisionShape3D debug color customization

3D collision shapes now have parity with their 2D counterparts with the newly added `debug_color` and `debug_fill` properties, which lets you customize the appearance of debug collision shapes in the editor, or at runtime if "Visible Collision Shapes" is enabled in the Debug menu. Thanks to first-time contributor [BattyBovine](https://github.com/BattyBovine) for implementing this much-requested proposal ([GH-90644](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/90644)).

### Replace internal CSG implementation with Manifold library

Godot added support for CSG, or Constructive Solid Geometry, [back in 3.1](/article/godot-gets-csg-support/). This is a great tool for rapidly prototyping level geometry or even simple props and characters by combining 3D primitives with various boolean operations (union, intersection, subtraction).

Our implementation suffered from a number of bugs and stability issues, with no dedicated maintainer to tackle them. Thankfully, a great open source library has been released since then which can be used as a well-maintained replacement for our CSG internals: [Emmett Lalish](https://github.com/elalish)'s [Manifold](https://github.com/elalish/manifold).

[Ernest Lee](https://github.com/fire) did an amazing work implementing Manifold in Godot, with help from Emmett to ensure that the library fits our requirements ([GH-94321](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/94321)). As this is a fairly big change to how Godot's CSG works internally (but with minimal impact on the user API), you might notice differences in your projects using CSG. Please report any change that appears to have a negative impact on your usage.

### Runtime WAV file loading

First-time contributor [cherry](https://github.com/what-is-a-git) implemented the long-requested support for runtime loading of WAV files ([GH-93831](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/93831)). This adds parity with OGG Vorbis audio tracks, and will be a welcome addition for users who want to load user-generated content at runtime (including non-game audio applications).

### Extend Curve to allow for domains outside of `[0, 1]`

Have you ever wished that you could edit a `Curve` in a domain that goes beyond the normalized `[0, 1]` range? [ocean](https://github.com/anvilfolk) finally got their implementation of this feature merged ([GH-67857](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/67857)), which should give you greater flexibility in how to map your functions and data to Godot's ubiquitous Curve resource.

### Temporary file and directory utilities

Tool creators, [Adam Scott](https://github.com/adamscott) cooked a little something that could be interesting for you. A brand new API lets you create and dispose of temporary files. Handy if you need to write content on disk, but without worrying about polluting user data. These temporary files and directories even dispose of themselves after use by default. For more information, see ([GH-98397](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/98397)).

## Known issues

With every release we accept that there are going to be various issues, which have already been reported but haven't been fixed yet. See the GitHub issue tracker for a complete list of [known bugs](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+).

Here are some known regressions introduced in this snapshot:

- Occlusion culling randomly occluding things completely in the open ([GH-10032](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/100032)).
  * A pull request is already open to fix this in the next dev snapshot ([GH-100060](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/100060)).
- Error "Manifold creation from mesh failed" with Plane and Quad shapes, which do not get rendered ([GH-100014](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/100014)).
  * Planes and Quads cannot be used with CSG, and just seemed to be usable previously. We'll improve the usability so they cannot be selected for CSGMesh3D. Instead, use MeshInstance3D to place Planes and Quads.

## Bug reports

As a tester, we encourage you to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in this snapshot).
