After our [GodotCon in Brussels in February 2018](/article/godotcon-2018-venue-and-call-proposals), we're preparing a new Godot Convention (GodotCon), this time in **Poznań, Poland** on **Wed 10 & Thu 11 October 2018**.

**TL;DR:**

- [Events page with all details](/events).
- [Registration form for GodotCon Poznań](https://framaforms.org/registration-godotcon-poznan-2018-1535467892).
- We need speakers for the event; contact me (Rémi) if you'd like to be one.
- Contact me if you want a discount code for [Game Industry Conference](https://gic.gd) passes (also in Poznań right after GodotCon).

------

Our lead developer [Juan Linietsky](https://github.com/reduz) is coming to Europe again from Argentina as a speaker for the [Game Industry Conference (GIC)](https://gic.gd) on 11-14 October 2018 in Poznań. We're taking this opportunity to organize a Godot-related side-event to GIC on the 10 & 11 October on the same premises.

As we mostly communicate online in the Godot community, including among core engine developers, such an event is a great opportunity to meet <abbr title="'In Real Life'">IRL</abbr> to get to know each other better, discuss and work on the engine as well as various community and game projects.

This is an international event, and as such we invite all Godot users and contributors within a reasonable distance of Poland to join us there! We're looking forward to meet the European Godot community again, and especially those of Central and Eastern Europe who may not have been able to attend the previous GodotCon in Brussels, Belgium.

## Practical information

[**See our Events page**](/events) for the details and pratical information, including links to relevant GIC pages with travel information. The Events page will be updated as we get more details about the event, especially regarding the speakers and schedule (see call for participation below).

The GodotCon will be free of charge, but we ask you to [**register via this form**](https://framaforms.org/registration-godotcon-poznan-2018-1535467892) so that we know who to expect, and how many attendees will be there.

Our GodotCon is graciously hosted as a side-event of [GIC](https://gic.gd), which will start on the evening after GodotCon. Juan will be giving a talk there, and we might also propose a Godot workshop. You are encouraged to attend GIC after GodotCon and meet thousands of game and engine developers. For that event the entry is paid, but we have 40% discount codes for the developer and business passes for GodotCon attendees, contact me (*remi at godotengine · org*) if you are interested.

## Call for participations

We now have a date, a venue, and several core developers and engine users registered for a great event in Poznań – next step is to define our line-up of speakers for GodotCon, who will be giving talks, workshops or other activities. That's where we need *you* to step up!

We're interested in any Godot-related topic. It can be a technical presentation of upcoming engine features, a round table between experienced developers, or a talk about your own Godot project, the tricks you're using in your workflow, etc. Basically, feel free to propose anything that you think could be worth sharing with fellow Godot users and/or contributors.

As an indication, we propose a duration of **20 minutes** (+ 5-10 min Q&A) for talks, though you can tell us if you'd prefer less or more time. A 5 min presentation of your game would be welcome, and a 30 min talk or workshop is fine too if the topic is worth it :) Even longer workshops could be imagined (e.g. 1h or 1h30) – we'll have a big room so we could run a long workshop on one end of the room while shorter talks happen on the other end.

Please send your proposals to *remi at godotengine · org*, with the following information:

- Type (talk, workshop, round table, live demo, live tutorial... feel free to think outside the box)
- Title
- Abstract (short description of what it will be about)
- Technical requirements (whether you need a projector, with or without sound, etc.)

Don't overthink the above too much, I'd prefer to know *ASAP* who may give a talk, and we can fill in more details later on.

**Note for Godot contributors:** This is your event, and we really want to see as many of you as possible to discuss current engine development topics live. We put some funds aside to cover reasonable travel expenses for events, and that could include you. If you would like to attend this GodotCon but it doesn't fit in your budget, contact me and we'll see on a case by case basis if we can help cover your travel costs (please get in touch with me *before* buying anything though, to get confirmation that we will cover some or all of your costs).
