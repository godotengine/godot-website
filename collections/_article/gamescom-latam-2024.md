Last year Godot had a [booth at the BIG Festival](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-at-big-festival-2023/) and it was a great success. This year the event has rebranded as [gamescom latam](https://latam.gamescom.global/) and once again we secured ourselves a booth. It will take place between **June 26th and June 30th** - make sure to come by if you are attending! We have stickers and pins waiting for you.

The BIG Festival was already the biggest event for game developers in Latin America and therefore a must to attend; with it now carrying the internationally recognizable name of gamescom one can only imagine how much it will continue to grow.

The event features a good amount of booths, with plenty of games to play and many people to meet. It also includes many talks in all areas of game development, all covered by the standard ticket. Not to mention the business area where one can schedule meetings with other companies to negotiate deals or form lasting connections.

The Godot booth is sponsored by a joint effort of [W4 Games](https://w4games.com/), [anitya](https://www.anitya.space/), and [Vertex Ludi](https://www.vertexludi.com/). It is a great place to meet the community and proof that we are here to stay. Looking at last year, we expect to have busy booth teeming with interesting conversations, as well as some merchandise to take home with you. A short talk titled ["**Godot and Its Emerging Ecosystem**"](https://b2b.latam.gamescom.global/talks/13/965) is also on the program, which will take place on **June 27** at **10:00** (local time) on the **Quest 2 stage**.

If that is not enough, thanks to our sponsors we will be hosting a Godot community gathering for about 100 people. The idea is to meet on a more casual level and get to know the local community better. Networking with likeminded game developers is key! This party is scheduled for the **June 27th** starting from **19:30** (local time). Make sure to register [here!](https://partiful.com/e/pOorzSXfk63wWfSssG3Z).

While many team members are unfortunately unable to attend due to travel logistics, we made sure to send local correspondents like [myself](https://github.com/vnen) and [Michael (Yeldham)](https://github.com/YeldhamDev) to this important event for the Latin American community regardless, to ensure Godot stays represented where it once started.

Staying in touch with the LATAM community is exciting, so we cannot wait for this event to come around. Will we meet you there?
