While we're busy working on both the upcoming Godot 4.0 and 3.4 releases (with a dev snapshot for [3.4 beta 3](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-3-4-beta-3) available now), we still cherry-pick important bug fixes to the 3.3 branch regularly for maintenance releases (see our [release policy](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.3/about/release_policy.html)).

[Godot 3.3.2](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-3-2) was released in May, and a number of useful fixes have been queued in the [`3.3` branch](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/3.3) since then, so now's a good time to push them in production.

As there is no new feature and only bug fixes, this RC 2 should be as stable as 3.3.2-stable and can be used in production if you need one of the fixes it includes.

A notable change in 3.3.2 RC 2 is that the **Android builds now target API level 30** [as required by Google Play](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk), and have partial support for Android scoped storage. The minimum API level has also been increased from 18 to 19.

As usual, you can try it live with the [**online version of the Godot editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/3.3.3.rc2/godot.tools.html) updated for this release.
