While we're busy working on both the upcoming Godot 4.0 and 3.4 releases (with a dev snapshot for [3.4 beta 5](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-3-4-beta-5) available now), we still cherry-pick important bug fixes to the 3.3 branch regularly for maintenance releases (see our [release policy](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.3/about/release_policy.html)).

[Godot 3.3.3](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-3-3) was released a month ago, and a handful of important fixes have been queued in the [`3.3` branch](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/3.3) since then. Most notably, users of the GDScript LSP in Visual Studio Code have been experiencing crashes in 3.3.3, which are fixed in this new **Godot 3.3.4**.

**Note:** Version numbers can be confusing with three branches worked on in parallel - this release is **3.3.4**, i.e. a maintenance update to the 3.3 branch. This is not the upcoming *3.4* feature release.

Godot 3.3.4, [like all future 3.3.x releases](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.3/about/release_policy.html), focuses purely on bug fixes, and aims to preserve compatibility. It is a recommended upgrade for all Godot 3.3 users.
