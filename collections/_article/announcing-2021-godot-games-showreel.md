The Godot games showreel for 2021 is up! As every year, more and more quality submissions fall in our hands, making the selection job very difficult. This year was not an exception, as we had had a record submission amount (over 300). This time, several core contributors had to take the work of ranking them to decide which would make up the final reel.

### Desktop / Console showreel

### Thanks

Thanks to everyone for submitting videos, Hugo Locurcio for editing, and thanks to Christian Perucchi for providing his music!

Stay tuned for an upcoming showreel video featuring applications made with Godot :)
