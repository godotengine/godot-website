For this release candidate we picked a calm, relaxing illustration picture, because that's what all contributors need now after months and months of hard work to finalize this release. What's currently in this third release candidate is pretty much what 4.0 stable will be. With all the amazing new features that we've often described on this blog and on social media, and with all the remaining bugs and usability issues that we want to iron out for future 4.x releases.

Open source software works best with a *release early, release often* strategy, and after more than 3 years of foundational work on Godot 4.0, we're eager to move back to [faster paced release cycles](https://godotengine.org/article/release-management-4-0-and-beyond) to iterate quickly on the more modern and flexible architecture that we've built for this major branch. So don't expect the imminent 4.0 release to be a silver bullet -- it will be a stable base for us to build upon, and a good start for you to start developing new projects which will mature alongside Godot 4.x.

You can also [try the Web editor](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.0.rc3/godot.editor.html) (early testing, it's still slow and unstable).

*The illustration picture is from a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfRb50J7hD8) by StayAtHomeDev for making an endless ocean scene with Godot 4.0. [StayAtHomeDev](https://www.youtube.com/@stayathomedev) make a lot of great Godot content on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@stayathomedev), including [This Week in Godot](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEHvj4yeNfeHArSU6U2a715ssJYYCnKCg), a weekly highlight of cool Godot projects.*

- GDScript: Add limit to call depth ([GH-72867](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72867)).
- GDScript: Fix error about enum typed arrays ([GH-72925](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72925)).
- GDScript: Fix infer on read-only property ([GH-73238](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/73238)).

  * This change involves a slight compatibility breakage for the behavior of the `is` operator. It now requires a type known as compile time, so it's not possible to use it to check if two variables have the same type. For this, use `typeof()` or the new `is_instance_of()` function.

## Known issues

With every release we accept that there are going to be various issues, which have already been reported but haven't been fixed yet. See the GitHub issue tracker for a list of [known bugs in the 4.0 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.0+label%3Abug+).

You will likely see this list reduced drastically over the coming days as we continue to re-triage those issues and postpone the ones that are not critical for the 4.0 release.

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

As in any major release, there are going to be compatibility-breaking changes. However, we still try to provide a migration path for your projects. If you experience a regression without a known migration path or workaround, do not hesitate to report it.
