This year, during GDC, GitHub again hosted a Godot Meetup at their offices and the amount of attendants was considerably bigger than last year. Thanks hugely to them for all their support!

We took the chance to do our GDC "keynote" presentation there, which we called "The State of Godot 2019". It was recorded and is now made available for everyone to see on GodotEngine's official youtube channel.
