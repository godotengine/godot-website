On a day like today, two years ago Godot was open sourced.

If you compare the current version with what was available back then, the difference is like night and day. I think it's safe to say that, as an OSS project it improved several times faster (and became several times more awesome) than when it was a closed in-house engine.

This is in large part because there are now several more developers working on it, but the main reason behind this large improvement is because the community feedback has been incredible. All your feedback helped us, developers, to understand how Godot should really be, in contrast to the lone vision of a few guys.

From the day it was opensourced, we tried to shape Godot according to your needs and ideas and this is the result.

So, thanks to all of you, and happy February 14th to all the valentines, the community and Godot!
