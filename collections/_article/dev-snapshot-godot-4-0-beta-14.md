With the first Godot 4.0 Release Candidate on the horizon we continue to release beta snapshots frequently and relentlessly! Such cadence allows us to better measure the overall stability and quickly catch regressions, especially when a lot of features are worked on at the same time.

This beta includes a few big changes which may interest a lot of users:

- Fixes to CanvasItem draw methods to better handled lines of different widths and filled rectangles ([GH-41239](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/41239), [GH-71623](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71623), [GH-71679](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71679)).
- A lot of minor fixes and improvements to TileMap and TileSet, both feature wise and in the editor ([GH-71604](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71604), [GH-71615](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71615), [GH-71618](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71618), [GH-71626](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71626), [GH-71630](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71630), [GH-71664](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71664)).
- Add next/reset function to AnimationStateMachine ([GH-71264](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71264), [GH-71418](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71418)).
- Add astcenc compression and decompression ([GH-70363](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70363)).
- Fix issue where failed start of OpenXR causes issues ([GH-71450](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71450)).
- For shaders, we removed the now-redundant `SCREEN_TEXTURE`, `DEPTH_TEXTURE`, and `NORMAL_ROUGHNESS_TEXTURE` ([GH-70967](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70967)). The PR and in-editor errors give instructions on what's the new way to access these features via hints.
- BiDi overrides are now properly handled to better display complex texts in the GDScript editor ([GH-71598](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71598)).

## What's new

If you're interested in an overview of what's new in Godot 4.0 beta in general, have a look at the detailed release notes for [4.0 beta 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-1). In this blog post, we will only cover the main changes since the previous beta release.

See the [**changelog on GitHub**](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/compare/caacade569eb7a541aaa7a8cdc3eedffca1422d9...28a24639c3c6a95b5b9828f5f02bf0dc2f5ce54b), or the [**list of merged PRs**](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2023-01-17T13%3A00..2023-01-20T10%3A00+is%3Amerged+sort%3Acreated-asc+milestone%3A4.0), for an overview of all changes since 4.0 beta 13 (73 commits – excluding merge commits ― from 40 contributors).

While we do our best to minimize compatibility breaking changes for existing beta users, there are still occasional changes in the API which may impact your Godot 4 projects. See the list of PRs with the [`breaks compat` label](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2023-01-17T13%3A00..2023-01-20T10%3A00+is%3Amerged+sort%3Acreated-asc+milestone%3A4.0+label%3A%22breaks+compat%22) for details.

See the GitHub issue tracker for a list of [known bugs in the 4.0 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.0+label%3Abug+).

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

As in any major release there are going to be compatibility breaking changes. However, we still try to provide a migration path for your projects. If you experience a regression without a known migration path or workaround, do not hesitate to report it.
