Hello! Calinou here. I've been a core Godot contributor for about 3 years now, working on the Godot editor, documentation and website.
On top of that, I've developed many Godot-related tools such as the
[unofficial Godot nightly builds](https://hugo.pro/projects/godot-builds/),
[Godot build options generator](https://godot-build-options-generator.github.io/) and the
[Godot class reference status viewer](https://godotengine.github.io/doc-status/).

This month, I was hired full-time by the Godot team to rework and improve Godot's web infrastructure.
While Godot's core engine now has many full-time developers working on it, the website and hosted platforms aren't as well-maintained in comparison.
Being a web developer by trade and a generalist at heart, this was a natural choice for me.

**Here are some of the items I'll be working on in the coming months:**

- [Create a *Godot Development Fund* page](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-website/pull/183) to summarize the paid developers' efforts and improve funding transparency.
- Deploy the [new asset library developed by yours truly](https://github.com/Calinou/godot-asset-library-laravel/).
- Create a new Showcase page featuring high-quality, published Godot projects.
- Update the homepage with newer screenshots rotating over time.
- Publish a community map with local communities.
- Update the design of the Features page to better showcase the new features coming in Godot 4.0.
- Integrate a Q&A system into the online Godot documentation.
- Improve the online Godot documentation's search to return more relevant results. Add a way to filter between the manual pages and the class reference.
- Add a C#/GDScript toggle to the online Godot documentation, to switch between `snake_case` and `PascalCase` naming conventions automatically.
- Update software used on the various Godot community platforms.
- Revise the web hosting setup for better performance and reliability.

This list is based on common suggestions from the community and may evolve in the future.

All my work is **public and open to feedback**, entirely done on GitHub.
