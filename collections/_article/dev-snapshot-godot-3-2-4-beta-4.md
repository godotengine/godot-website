While development keeps going at full speed towards Godot 4.0 (see recent devblogs on [GDScript typed instructions](/article/gdscript-progress-report-typed-instructions), [Complex Text Layout](/article/complex-text-layouts-progress-report-2), [Tiles editor](/article/tiles-editor-rework), [documentation](/article/godot-docs-improvements-report), and [2D rendering improvements](https://godotengine.org/article/godots-2d-engine-gets-several-improvements-upcoming-40)!), a lot of work is also being done on the `3.2` branch for the upcoming Godot 3.2.4.

This new **beta 4** adds a new round of bugfixes and enhancements over the previous dev snapshots, as well as some nice new features.

In particular, this build adds [optional GDNative support to the HTML5 target](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44076), on top of the pre-existing optional multithreading support. The HTML5 export templates now come in three flavors which you can select in the export preset: normal, threads enabled and GDNative enabled. Multithreading and dynamic linking (GDNative) can't be used at the same time due to current WebAssembly limitations.<br>
**Note:** Threads enabled and GDNative enabled templates are only available for standard builds for now, as there are other issues to solve to make them work with Mono.

Additionally, beta 4 adds support for [MP3 loading and playback](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/43007)! Until recently, the MP3 audio format was patent-encumbered and could therefore not be included in Godot, but the last patent expired in 2017, so a MP3 loader and decoded could finally be implemented.

There are also a number of [fixes to the rewritten FBX importer](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/43921) which should improve compatibility, so if you ran into issues with it in previous builds, make sure to retry your models!

## Highlights

The main changes coming in Godot 3.2.4 and included in this beta are:

- [Android App Bundle](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/342) and [subview embedding](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/1064) support.
- [2D batching for GLES3](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/42119) (it was implemented for GLES2 in 3.2.2), and improvements to GLES2's batching.
- [A new software skinning for MeshInstance](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/40313) to replace the slow GPU skinning on devices that don't support the fast GPU skinning (especially mobile).
- [Rewritten and greatly improved FBX importer](/article/fbx-importer-rewritten-for-godot-3-2-4).
- [Improved Web editor prototype](/article/godot-web-progress-report-3) and [AudioWorklet support for multithreaded HTML5 builds](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/43454).
- [New option to snap 2D transforms to whole coordinates](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/43554), helps prevent jitter on pixel art camera motions.
- [Configurable amount of lights per object](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/43606), now defaulting to 32 instead of 8.
- [macOS ARM64 support](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/39788) in official binaries for Apple M1 chip (only classical build for now).
- [Optional GDNative support for HTML5](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44076) (new in beta 4).
- [MP3 loading and playback support](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/43007) (new in beta 4).


And there's even more in the works that will be included in future beta builds.

## Downloads

The download links for dev snapshots are not featured on the [Download](/download) page to avoid confusion for new users. Instead, browse our download repository and fetch the editor binary that matches your platform:

- [Standard build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2.4/beta4/) (GDScript, GDNative, VisualScript).
- [Mono build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2.4/beta4/mono/) (C# support + all the above). You need to have MSBuild installed to use the Mono build. Relevant parts of Mono 6.12.0.111 are included in this build.

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with 3.2.4 beta 4. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in 3.2.3 or earlier no longer works in 3.2.4 beta 4).
