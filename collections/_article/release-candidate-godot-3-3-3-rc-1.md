While we're busy working on both the upcoming Godot 4.0 and 3.4 releases (with a dev snapshot for [3.4 beta 2](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-3-4-beta-2) available now), we still cherry-pick important bug fixes to the 3.3 branch regularly for maintenance releases (see our [release policy](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.3/about/release_policy.html)).

[Godot 3.3.2](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-3-2) was released in May, and a number of useful fixes have been queued in the [`3.3` branch](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/3.3) since then, so now's a good time to push them in production.

As there is no new feature and only bug fixes, this RC 1 should be as stable as 3.3.2-stable and can be used in production if you need one of the fixes it includes.

As usual, you can try it live with the [**online version of the Godot editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/3.3.3.rc1/godot.tools.html) updated for this release.

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with 3.3.3 RC 1.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in 3.3 no longer works in 3.3.3 RC 1).
