Two weeks ago we wrapped up the development of [Godot 4.1](/article/godot-4-1-is-here), bringing more polish and stability to the Godot 4 series, and just two days ago we shipped its [first maintenance release](/article/maintenance-release-godot-4-1-1), addressing some of the more urgent issues that slipped in. In preparation for both of these releases we temporarily put aside many improvements to ensure stability and to avoid any last minute regressions.

Today, we are ready to share these improvements with you with **4.2 dev 1** being available for public testing (you can read about the most notable changes [below](#whats-new)). This first development snapshot marks the proper start of the new development cycle, which means in the coming weeks we will be quickly merging many changes as contributors implement new features and fix long-standing bugs. You should expect a dev snapshot every 1 or 2 weeks, depending on how stable the development branch is after any given series of merges.

Please note that dev 1 includes many changes that just barely missed being included in 4.1, so expect it to be a little bit more feature packed than normal dev builds.

Keep in mind that while we try to make sure each dev snapshot is stable enough for general testing, this is by definition a pre-release piece of software. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also [try the **Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.2.dev1/) or the **Android editor** for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join [our testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds.

*The illustration picture for this article is from* [**Terrain3D**](https://github.com/outobugi/Terrain3D) *— an editor plugin for 3D terrain sculpting and painting, created by [Roope Palmroos](https://github.com/outobugi) ([Outobugi Games](https://outobugi.com/)) and [Cory Petkovsek](https://github.com/TokisanGames) ([Tokisan Games](https://tokisan.com/)). This is an essential tool for any open world 3D game, and it's made from the ground up for Godot 4. The project is in alpha, but stable enough for public testing — so download it now from [GitHub](https://github.com/outobugi/Terrain3D)! Also follow Roope ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/outobugi), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@outobugi)) and Cory ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/TokisanGames), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@TokisanGames)) on social for more updates on their ongoing projects, built with Terrain3D.*
