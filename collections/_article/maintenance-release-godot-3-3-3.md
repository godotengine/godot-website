While we're busy working on both the upcoming Godot 4.0 and 3.4 releases (with a dev snapshot for [3.4 beta 4](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-3-4-beta-4) available now), we still cherry-pick important bug fixes to the 3.3 branch regularly for maintenance releases (see our [release policy](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.3/about/release_policy.html)).

Since the release of [Godot 3.3.2 in May](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-3-2), there have been a number of bug fixes which are worth including in a new stable release for all Godot users.

Additionally, this release fulfills a new [Google Play requirement](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk) for Android to target the API level 30 (Android 11). This includes partial support for Android scoped storage, which will be expanded in future releases.

Godot 3.3.3, [like all future 3.3.x releases](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.3/about/release_policy.html), focuses purely on bug fixes, and aims to preserve compatibility. It is a recommended upgrade for all Godot 3.3 users.
