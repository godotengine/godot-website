After the success of our previous games jams in [March 2016](/article/godot-gamejam-march-2016) and [June 2016](/article/godot-gamejam-june-2016), and since the community seemed pretty motivated for a new one, we are organizing a new Godot Community Game Jam that will run from **16 December 2016 to 31 January 2017**.

As the previous one, it is an informal jam with relatively loose rules, and not much to gain apart from international fame within the Godot community and more experience with using our great engine! This is why this jam will run for a month and a half, giving everyone plenty of time to experiment with the engine to create something new, beginners and experienced users alike.

## Jam theme and rules

The jam will take place from Friday, December 16th 2016 to Tuesday, January 31st 2017, i.e. for one month and a half. [It is hosted on itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/godotjam122016).

The guys from the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/qZtf8) took the initiative and gathered some theme proposals, which were then submitted to the vote of the community. The proposal that received the most votes is **Two buttons**, and it will therefore be the main theme of the jam. The other proposals were *Demake*, *No-death*, *Rust / decay* and *Round-based* - those are not part of the voting criteria, but you are free to take them as an additional source of inspiration for your games.

Contestants are free to interpret the theme as they want, but keep in mind that your interpretation should be understandable if you want voters to give you many points for it.

Contestants can partake alone or as a team. Reusing existing code and assets is allowed.

## Open source and educational

We see this jam as an opportunity for each community member to share their knowledge with other users, which is why we ask that all games developed for this jam are published with their source code and assets under [open source licenses](http://choosealicense.org/), thus helping build quality examples for new Godot users.

Of course jam participants are free to continue their game after the jam as a proprietary project if they want - only the jam version should be open source for the whole community to learn from it.

The minimum requirement for a valid jam entry is thus to provide the full source code to play the game; you are of course welcome to also post exported binaries for players that might not be familiar with running Godot projects from source.

## Have fun!

The main purpose of this jam is to have fun together as a community of Godot users. If you are beginning with Godot, don't hesitate to ask any question [on our various community channels](/community); there are no silly questions, so go ahead!

If you are more experienced, why not take this opportunity to try to discover new [features](/features) of Godot that you might not be using yet (e.g. shaders, particles)? You may also use the current development version of Godot 3.0 (no GLES 3 support yet in the master branch though) to do some alpha-testing while working on your jam game.

Good luck everyone, and enjoy the jam!
