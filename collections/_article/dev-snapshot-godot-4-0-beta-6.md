Godot 4.0 has been in beta for [a little over two months](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-1), and the overall feature completeness, stability and usability have improved a lot during that time.

We've had beta snapshots every other week, and now we've decided to accelerate the cadence to release a new snapshot every week, to get even faster feedback on our bugfixes, and the potential regressions they may introduce.

This beta 6 includes a few big changes which may interest a lot of users:

- GDScript cyclic reference issues begone! Or so we hope, with the amazing work done by [Adam Scott](https://github.com/adamscott/) in [GH-66714](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/67714). It has been tested thoroughly before merging, but the real trial starts now, with users trying out beta 6 on existing big GDScript codebases. Some regressions are to be expected, so please report any issue and mention differences in behavior between betas.
- Lots of improvements to the Multiplayer features, and notably the editor tooling. With all this, [Fabio](https://github.com/Faless/) expects this API to be feature complete, so please test the new features and report any issue!
- Beta testers were starting to be vocal about the missing implementation of the Canvas Enviroment background mode, so [Clay](https://github.com/clayjohn/) went ahead and fixed it! ([GH-68805](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/68805)).
- [Tokage](https://github.com/TokageItLab) greatly optimized the animation blend tree process, which should give a nice performance boost on complex animations ([GH-68593](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/68593)).

As we are still in the early beta phase of development, there are still many issues to fix, some of which have already been reported and are being worked on. See the GitHub issue tracker for a list of [known bugs in the 4.0 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.0+label%3Abug+).

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

As in any major release there are going to be compatibility breaking changes. However, we still try to provide a migration path for your projects. If you experience a regression without a known migration path or workaround, do not hesitate to report it.
