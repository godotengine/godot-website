***Edit:** We have seen many comments on our April Fool's joke. We strive to make the Godot community, and game development in general, a welcoming place for everyone. By not understanding the various ways in which our joke could be interpreted we have failed in this goal.*

*The Godette character was made [years ago](https://twitter.com/reduzio/status/958305883976536064). It was not created for this joke. The joke itself was intended to poke fun at a very vocal minority of users who think that our robot logo isn't "professional", thus the joke was us pretending to be switching to an even more playful character.*

*Having said that: our intention does not matter if so many people interpreted the article in the way they did. We apologize for the oversight. We strive to do better in the future.*

After months of internal debate, we have decided to deal once and for all with a hot topic and the source of much criticism. Godot is being rebranded in order to gain wider commercial appeal.

### Epiphany

It may have taken us a long time, but we finally understood and accept that Godot is about reaching *wider audiences*, about making something ***ultimate***, about going be beyond what ***any other game engine*** has ever attempted.

We thought we had ***everything***. Passionate contributors, an amazing community, and dedicated leadership. Yet, something ***kept getting in our way*** and we could not figure what it was. Sleepless nights and months of ~~watching anime during lockd~~heated debate were required for us to achieve epiphany, the realization that something had to change.

### The Godot name

How are we supposed to work on something ~~the English speak~~no one knows how to pronounce? Is it Go-Dot, Go-DOUGH? GOH-do? Robot? Not even the original authors have a clue when you ask them.

Additionally, we realized that a big problem of Godot as a project name is that it's simply ***not cute***. To attract wider audiences, a different name must be found, a more marketable one which speaks to a broader public. 

### The Godot logo

Since Godot was open sourced, we received countless amount of criticism from a ~~small vocal min~~majority of the community, pointing out the lack of professionalism of the Godot logo. Have you ever read comments from community members like these?

- It doesn't look like the logo of a commercial game engine.
- I would not pay for something with this logo.
- The robot scares me; I can't sleep at night.
- Uh, I thought the original logo was a guy's head popping out of a castle tower, now the new one does not even make sense.
- I'm afraid of clowns.

Yes, we did too. They are all over the place. They are the writing on the wall we would refuse to see.

### The NEW branding 

After weeks of consultation with ~~Reddit users~~[**professional marketing experts**](https://twitter.com/reduzio/status/1367975083562655745), it was decided to rebrand both Godot and its logo to convey a more professional branding. From now on, the project will be known as **Godette Engine** and the new logo will reflect this:

![Godette Engine](/storage/app/uploads/public/606/4f9/ed1/6064f9ed122b5192659480.png)

We'll now use this branding for the engine, and our website is hosted at [**https://godetteengine.org**](https://godetteengine.org).

Our official Twitter account has also been moved over to [@godetteengine](https://twitter.com/godetteengine) so make sure to give it a follow.

### More changes coming

Also, in order to make the engine more commercially appealing, we are evaluating other changes, such as moving the engine to a premium *shared revenue* model, *increasing* the download size to a few gigabytes, and making any kind of help or support *paid*. A bright future is coming for our ~~sharehold~~community. We hope to be able to tell you more very soon (probably on April 2, since it's now April 1).
