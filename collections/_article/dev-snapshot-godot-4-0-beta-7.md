Godot 4.0 has been in beta for [over two months](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-1), and the overall feature completeness, stability and usability have improved a lot during that time.

We've had beta snapshots every other week, and now we've decided to accelerate the cadence to release a new snapshot every week, to get even faster feedback on our bugfixes, and the potential regressions they may introduce.

Some big changes in this beta:
- Android: Enable GLES3 support ([GH-69355](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/69355)).
- Core: Move `z_index`, `z_as_relative` and `y_sort_enabled` from Node2D to CanvasItem ([GH-68070](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/68070)).
- C#: Tons of improvements!
- GDScript: Loads of follow-up improvements to recent fixes in beta 5 and 6.
