While [Godot 3.5](/article/release-candidate-godot-3-5-rc-6) is nearing a stable release, we still want to provide relevant bug fixes to users of the current **3.4** stable branch who might not be ready to upgrade right away. It's been a long time since the release of [Godot 3.4.4](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-4-4), and there are a few important fixes coming up in Godot 3.4.5.

This [Release Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate) is intended to help validate those fixes and make sure that Godot 3.4.5 is ready to publish.

Notable changes that motivate this release include:
- Increase Android target API level to 31 to match Google Play requirements for new apps as of August 2022.
- Update mbedtls and zlib libraries to fix security vulnerabilities.
- Ignore support of S3TC compression format on mobile devices to ensure the use of ETC2 for GLES3 (fixes issues with Meta Quest 2 after a recent system update).
