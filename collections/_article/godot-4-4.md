This release we decided to do things a little bit differently. Instead of making a giant blog post, we have decided to make a giant [web page](/releases/4.3/) instead! Inspired by Blender, we have decided to create a stable page on the website that features releases so new users can quickly learn about the latest version of the engine.

So please take a look over at the [4.3 release page](/releases/4.3/)!

Or grab 4.3 here directly and get started.

{% include articles/download_card.html version="4.3" release="stable" article=page %}

**Standard build** includes support for GDScript and GDExtension.

**.NET build** (marked as `mono`) includes support for C#, as well as GDScript and GDExtension.
- See also [C# platform support](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/index.html#c-platform-support).

If you want to test the new Windows ARM64 builds, you will now find them listed in the usual download page.

## Support

Godot is a non-profit, open source game engine developed by hundreds of contributors on their free time, as well as a handful of part or full-time developers hired thanks to [generous donations from the Godot community](https://fund.godotengine.org/). A big thank you to everyone who has contributed [their time](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/AUTHORS.md) or [their financial support](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/DONORS.md) to the project!

If you'd like to support the project financially and help us secure our future hires, you can do so using the [Godot Development Fund](https://fund.godotengine.org/) platform managed by [Godot Foundation](https://godot.foundation/). There are also several [alternative ways to donate](/donate) which you may find more suitable.
