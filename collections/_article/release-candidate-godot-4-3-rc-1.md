We are entering the final stage of development for Godot 4.3, which is the [Release Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate): all features are in-place, the most critical regressions have been tackled, and so we're confident that it's now ready for general use in the vast majority of cases...

... which is usually the cue for more testing to jump aboard the pre-release train, test this release candidate on their projects, and ~shatter our hopes~ confirm that everything is ready for prime time!

More seriously, Godot is a big piece of software and it's hard for contributors and even unit tests to validate all areas of the engine when developing new features or bug fixes. So we rely on extensive testing from the community to find engine issues while testing dev, beta, and RC snapshots in your projects, and reporting them so that we can fix them prior to tagging the 4.3-stable release.

Please, consider [supporting the project financially](https://fund.godotengine.org), if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors. Your donations go towards sponsoring their work and ensuring they can dedicate their undivided attention to the needs of the project.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also [try the **Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.3.rc1/) or the **Android editor** for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join [our testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds.

The game was revealed in early July and just got a playable demo [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3052500/ColdRidge/), where you can also wishlist it.*

## Highlights

We covered the most important highlights from Godot 4.3 in the previous [4.3 beta 1 blog post](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-3-beta-1/), so if you haven't read that one, have a look to be introduced to the main new features added in the 4.3 release.

Especially if you're testing 4.3 for the first time, you'll want to get a condensed overview of what new features you might want to make use of.

This section covers changes made since the previous [beta 3 snapshot](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-3-beta-3/), which are mostly regression fixes, or "safe" fixes to longstanding issues.

There are two big highlights in this release for the Windows platform though:

- The Direct3D 12 rendering backend now works out of the box on Windows, and no longer requires copying the `DXIL.dll` library ([GH-94203](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/94203))! This is thanks to Microsoft's decision to [open source the DXIL Validator hash](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/open-sourcing-dxil-validator-hash/), which was the only reason for us to require the proprietary `DXIL.dll`. Aside from greatly simplifying the distribution of Windows builds with D3D12, it also makes it possible to export Windows D3D12 projects from other OSes (Linux, macOS, Android), which is an important part of Godot's cross-platform support.
- With the progressive rollout of Windows ARM64 devices on the market, we've finalized our support for that target and now provide Windows ARM64 builds (editor and export templates) for both [Standard](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-builds/releases/download/4.3-rc1/Godot_v4.3-rc1_windows_arm64.exe.zip) and [.NET](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-builds/releases/download/4.3-rc1/Godot_v4.3-rc1_mono_windows_arm64.zip) flavors. Thanks to Qualcomm engineers who did some testing and gave us access to cloud-based devices to confirm that the binaries work.

## Known issues

During the Release Candidate stage, we focus exclusively on solving showstopping regressions (i.e. something that worked in a previous release is now broken, without workaround). You can have a look at our current [list of regressions and significant issues](https://github.com/orgs/godotengine/projects/61) which we aim to address before releasing 4.3. This list is dynamic and will be updated if we discover new blocking issues after more users start testing the RC snapshots.

With every release, we are aware that there are going to be various issues which have already been reported but haven't been fixed yet, due to limited resources. See the GitHub issue tracker for a complete list of [known bugs](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+).

## Bug reports

As a tester, we encourage you to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in this snapshot).

## Support

Godot is a non-profit, open source game engine developed by hundreds of contributors on their free time, as well as a handful of part or full-time developers hired thanks to [generous donations from the Godot community](https://fund.godotengine.org/). A big thank you to everyone who has contributed [their time](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/AUTHORS.md) or [their financial support](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/DONORS.md) to the project!
