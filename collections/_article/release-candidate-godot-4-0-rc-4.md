As the stable release is imminent, release candidates become more frequent to validate the last minutes fixes we had to make. This fourth release candidate includes a number of important fixes which we decided to include, and which require heavy testing to ensure that the bugs and regressions that they aim to fix are solved, without introducing new regressions.

## Downloads

The downloads for this dev snapshot can be found directly on our repository:

* [Standard build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.0/rc4/) (GDScript, GDExtension).
* [.NET 6 build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.0/rc4/mono) (C#, GDScript, GDExtension).
  - Requires [.NET SDK 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) or [7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) installed in a standard location.

## Known issues

With every release we accept that there are going to be various issues, which have already been reported but haven't been fixed yet. See the GitHub issue tracker for a list of [known bugs in the 4.0 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.0+label%3Abug+).

- Game using HDR texture crashes when exported (texture_format/bptc defaults to false) ([GH-73789](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/73789)).
  * This is a configuration issue, you can set `texture_format/bptc` to `true` in your PC export presets, and disable `texture_format/no_bptc_fallbacks`. The defaults settings will be fixed for the next build.

You will likely see this list reduced drastically over the coming days as we continue to re-triage those issues and postpone the ones that are not critical for the 4.0 release.

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

As in any major release, there are going to be compatibility-breaking changes. However, we still try to provide a migration path for your projects. If you experience a regression without a known migration path or workaround, do not hesitate to report it.
