With great excitement, today we want to officially announce the great honor of having been awarded an Epic MegaGrant!

This is a huge honor for us and greatly helps to keep on improving Godot development at an even greater pace. We want to personally thank Tim Sweeney for the encouragement and support, and for sharing the belief that open source software makes the world a better place.

## The grant

Godot applied for a $250k usd grant for the category of open source graphics software, (which does not have the necessary requirement to be related to Unreal Engine), and expressed the wish to use the grant to improve graphics rendering as well as our built-in- game development language, GDScript.

Both are areas where the Godot contributor community consistently innovates and we believe this effort, together with the very permissive license, can eventually be used to benefit the industry as a whole.

The grant was awarded at the beginning of this month and we are still discussing the next steps to follow.

## Future

We are still discussing how the budget will be used and allocated so expect announcements (and many improved features) soon thanks to it.

Stay tuned for more news!
