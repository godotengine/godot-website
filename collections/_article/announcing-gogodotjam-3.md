It's time for 2022's first [GoGodotJam](https://gogodotjam.com/)!

GoGodotJam is a Festival that celebrates Godot's Awesome Community. Join them in live events with tutorials, workshops, interviews and more - all culminating with a Game Jam.

In this edition there will be not one, but two Game Jams:
- [GoGodotJam CLASSIC](https://itch.io/jam/go-godot-jam-3) - for people that want to participate casually, with a timespan of 2 weekends and one week using the same recipe as the last 2 editions
- [GoGodotJam ULTRA](https://gotm.io/jam/gogodotjam-ultra/1) - for people that want a challenge, like high-risk high-reward situations and, of course, big prizes: $240+ and counting

Here is the full schedule:
* Full event: 10th of May - 18th of June
* Game Jam Classic: 27th of May - 6th of June
* Game Jam ULTRA: 27th of May - 31th of May
* Results ULTRA: 7th of Jun
