title: "Announcing the 2020 showreel!"
excerpt: "The showreel for 2020 is up! As every year, more and more quality submissions fall in our hands, making the selection job very difficult. This year was not the exception, and it was even more difficult as wehad had record submission amount (over 200) so, this time, several core contributors took the work of ranking and voting them to decide which would make up the final reel."
