After 4 months of development it's time to aim for the 3.2.4 stable release to bring the *numerous* new features and even more important bug fixes to all Godot users.

So here's a first [Release Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate) to get broader testing of everything that has been iterated upon in the past 6 beta builds.

You can try it live with the [**online version of the Godot editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/3.2.4.rc1/godot.tools.html) updated for this release.

## Highlights

The main changes coming in Godot 3.2.4 and included in this Release Candidate are:

- [Android App Bundle](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/342) and [subview embedding](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/1064) support.
- [2D batching for GLES3](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/42119) (it was implemented for GLES2 in 3.2.2), and improvements to GLES2's batching.
- [A new software skinning for MeshInstance](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/40313) to replace the slow GPU skinning on devices that don't support the fast GPU skinning (especially mobile).
- [Rewritten and greatly improved FBX importer](/article/fbx-importer-rewritten-for-godot-3-2-4).
- [Improved Web editor](/article/godot-web-progress-report-3) and [AudioWorklet support for multithreaded HTML5 builds](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/43454).
- [New option to snap 2D transforms to whole coordinates](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/43554), helps prevent jitter on pixel art camera motions.
- [Configurable amount of lights per object](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/43606), now defaulting to 32 instead of 8.
- [macOS ARM64 support](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/39788) in official binaries for Apple M1 chip (only classical build for now).
- [Optional GDNative support for HTML5](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44076).
- [MP3 loading and playback support](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/43007).
- [WebXR support for VR games](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/42397).
- [Minimap support in GraphEdit](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/43416).
- [Fixes to Mono on WebAssembly](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44374).
- [New CPU lightmapper](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44628).
- [New dynamic <abbr title="Bounding Volume Hierarchy">BVH</abbr>](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44901) for rendering and the GodotPhysics backends.
  * If you experience a regression in either physics or rendering, you can try [these Project Settings](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44901#issuecomment-758618531) to revert back to the previous Octree-based approach and possibly fix the issue. In either case, be sure to report the problem on GitHub.
- [iOS plugins support](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/41340), with a similar interface to Android plugins.
- [Multiple fixes to one-way collisions](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/42574).
- [New `AspectRatioContainer` Control node](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/45129).

And there's even more in the works that will be included in future beta builds.

This release is built from commit [dae72fcdd50094ef909ab99b7d19e46cdec463d5](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/dae72fcdd50094ef909ab99b7d19e46cdec463d5).

## Downloads

The download links for dev snapshots are not featured on the [Download](/download) page to avoid confusion for new users. Instead, browse our download repository and fetch the editor binary that matches your platform:

- [Standard build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2.4/rc1/) (GDScript, GDNative, VisualScript).
- [Mono build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2.4/rc1/mono/) (C# support + all the above). You need to have MSBuild installed to use the Mono build. Relevant parts of Mono 6.12.0.114 are included in this build.

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with 3.2.4 RC 1. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in 3.2.3 or earlier no longer works in 3.2.4 RC 1).
