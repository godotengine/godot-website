The upcoming Godot 3.4 release will provide a number of new features which have been backported from the 4.0 development branch (see our [release policy](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/release_policy.html) for details on the various Godot versions). This **beta 5** build provides additional features and fixes to bugs reported against previous builds.

If you already reviewed the changelog for the previous beta, you can skip right to the differences between beta 4 and beta 5 ([part 1](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/compare/6a058cbf3984131f94c8680970f3c184ddecc801...25cbb858bcf1bd1e8dafada2bbab9621c68b515e), [part 2](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/compare/25cbb858bcf1bd1e8dafada2bbab9621c68b515e...dd0ee487280d1a6dc4941235cc85bf211cebc444)).

Some big changes since the previous beta are the promotion of [object validity checks to release builds](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/51796) (no more "dangling pointers" release surprises), initial support for [Android Play Asset Delivery](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/52526), and a new [ACES Fitted high quality tonemapper](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/52477).

As usual, you can try it live with the [**online version of the Godot editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/3.4.beta5/godot.tools.html) updated for this release.

This release is built from commit [dd0ee487280d1a6dc4941235cc85bf211cebc444](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/dd0ee487280d1a6dc4941235cc85bf211cebc444).

## Downloads

The download links for dev snapshots are not featured on the [Download](/download) page to avoid confusion for new users. Instead, browse our download repository and fetch the editor binary that matches your platform:

- [Standard build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.4/beta5/) (GDScript, GDNative, VisualScript).
- [Mono build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.4/beta5/mono/) (C# support + all the above). You need to have dotnet CLI or MSBuild installed to use the Mono build. Relevant parts of Mono **6.12.0.147** are included in this build.

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with 3.4 beta 5. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in 3.3.3 or earlier no longer works in 3.4 beta 5).
