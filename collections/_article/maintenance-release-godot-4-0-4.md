It has been a busy few months since the release of [Godot 4.0.3](/article/maintenance-release-godot-4-0-3), the previous stable version of the 4.0 branch. And while some of the developers took the opportunity to migrate their projects to the latest release of [Godot 4.1.1](/article/maintenance-release-godot-4-1-1) or even to try our experimental builds of [Godot 4.2](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-2-dev-2), many others chose to pin the version and stick to it for the sake of stability.

And so it's our goal to improve said stability as long as we can manage it. Godot 4.0.4 contains a multitude of changes — addressing reported issues, performance problems and some frictions in the usability department. It also adds some of the missing documentation, and corrects a few mistakes in existing descriptions.

One important change in this release is a security fix for a potential denial of service when using ENet. If your project uses `ENetMultiplayerPeer` or the low-level `ENetConnection`, then we strongly recommend updating to this version. Thanks to [Facundo Fernández](https://github.com/Facundo15) for reporting this vulnerability. A patch has been submitted to the upstream ENet repository as well.

[**Download Godot 4.0.4 now**](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/tag/4.0.4-stable) or try the [online version of the Godot editor](https://editor.godotengine.org/4.0.4.stable/).

*The illustration picture used for this release is from* [**Sky Runner**](https://leon-stansfield.itch.io/sky-runner) *— a speed running game by [Leon Stansfield](https://twitter.com/Leonstansfield0) where your goal is simple: get from point A to point B... across a set of sky islands with some tricks up your sleeve. It's being made with Godot 4 and you get try out the demo on [itch.io](https://leon-stansfield.itch.io/sky-runner) right now! You should also follow Leon on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Leonstansfield0) or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@leonstansfield) for updates and other demos and experiments that he creates with Godot.*
