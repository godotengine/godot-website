This has been a long road, but the exciting times are upon us! Thanks to our excellent contributors and our brave volunteer beta testers we are reaching the biggest milestone in the history of Godot so far. We are about to release Godot 4.0 stable. We are very proud of how it has shaped up, the features and enhancements that have been implemented, and most of all, we are proud to have collected such a brilliant team of talented individuals who have carried this major release on their wide and mighty shoulders.

But before we can cut the ribbon and break out the champagne, there are still a few preview releases we must go through, to establish, with your help, that we are truly ready. What you can expect from the next couple of weeks is the same cadence of official builds, aiming to minimize the iteration time between fixing bugs and checking for regressions. We will no longer make any breaking changes or include further enhancements. New features will have to [wait for Godot 4.1 later this year](/article/release-management-4-0-and-beyond). Instead, we will be coming down on the last critical issues we want to be resolved before we ship the first stable release of Godot 4.

There certainly will be remaining bugs, and your experience won't be as frictionless as it is in the current stable version of Godot 3. It will take time to get to the same level of polish, but hopefully less time than before, thanks to our extended team of developers, and also new members learning about Godot only now and sharing their valuable feedback.

We are committed to evolving the engine further, and hope to see more of your amazing Godot projects soon!

## Highlights

As we keep iterating from previous beta releases, these release notes are focused on the most recent changes (since beta 17). If you're interested in what major features ship with Godot 4.0, check out our blog post for [beta 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-1). Stay tuned for more articles about new features as we get closer to the stable version.

This release candidate includes some big changes which may interest a lot of users:

- A large number of invalid behaviors is now correctly validated and reported in GDScript files ([GH-72608](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72608)). This includes some behaviors that previously appeared as working correctly but were never actually supported by the engine (such as override/shadowing of the engine's native methods). You can turn errors into warnings, or disable them completely if you need to.

- `CanvasGroup` nodes will no longer appear darker than they should due to an incorrect shading logic ([GH-72695](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72695)).

- The remaining reported cases of sub-resources IDs being shuffled without user input should now be resolved ([GH-72257](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72257)). While the issue should be fixed, this is not the final solution to the problem. We will continue improving the underlying systems in future versions of Godot to avoid this kind of situation.

- A list of all global scripted classes can now be accessed with a new method, `ProjectSettings.get_global_class_list()` ([GH-71665](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71665)). This method provides the information about your custom classes, which you cannot fetch from `ClassDB`, and previously had to parse from the project file, or a cache file.

- Under certain conditions, namely when particles were involved, stepping through the debugger might have been extremely slow and unresponsive. This should now be fixed ([GH-72827](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72827)).

- Translation resources have been reorganized to reduce their impact on the size of the main repository ([GH-70623](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70623)). We have also finished setting up the [Weblate platform](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/godot-engine/) for Godot 4, so translation efforts can begin!

## Downloads

The downloads for this dev snapshot can be found directly on our repository:

* [Standard build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.0/rc1/) (GDScript, GDExtension).
* [.NET 6 build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.0/rc1/mono) (C#, GDScript, GDExtension).
  - Requires [.NET SDK 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) or [7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) installed in a standard location. .NET 7.0 support was recently merged and requires testing, please report any issue you experience with either version.

## Known issues

With every release we accept that there are going to be various issues, which have already been reported but haven't been fixed yet. See the GitHub issue tracker for a list of [known bugs in the 4.0 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.0+label%3Abug+).

You will likely see this list reduced drastically over the coming days as we continue to re-triage those issues and postpone the ones that are not critical for the 4.0 release.

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

As in any major release, there are going to be compatibility-breaking changes. However, we still try to provide a migration path for your projects. If you experience a regression without a known migration path or workaround, do not hesitate to report it.
