We released [Godot 3.4.1](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-4-1) just a few days ago with a huge array of bugfixes, but a regression was then found for macOS rendering which could cause flickering.

This new **Godot 3.4.2** is a hotfix release to solve this and a few other minor issues that were fixed in the meantime. Godot 3.4.2 is a **recommended upgrade for all Godot 3.4 and 3.4.1 users**.

For a detailed overview of the changes that 3.4.1 included and which are also part of this new release, please read the [3.4.1 release notes](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-4-1).
