We're getting prepared for the imminent release of Godot 4.0 beta 1, and to do so we're having a (last?) alpha 17 release to ensure that things work as best as we can reasonably expect before the beta phase.

Some noteworthy changes in this release:

- Add option to convert project from 3.x to 4.0 from the Project Manager ([GH-64927](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/64927)).
- Refactored Android input implementation with better handling of gestures ([GH-65434](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/65434)).
- .NET 6 support no longer requires libnethost, makes it easier to build([GH-65438](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/65438)).
- Allow images to be imported "for editor use" and respect editor settings ([GH-64938](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/64938)).
- Fix Ctrl/Cmd key remapping changes when moving from macOS to other platform ([GH-65241](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/65241)).
- Fix multiwindow support in GLES3 for X11, Windows and macOS ([GH-65727](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/65727)).

Be aware that during the alpha stage the engine is still not feature-complete or stable. **There will likely be breaking changes between this release and the first [*beta* release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta).** Only the beta will mark the so-called "feature freeze".

As such, we do not recommend porting existing projects to this and other upcoming alpha releases unless you are prepared to do it again to fix future incompatibilities. However, if you can port some existing projects and demos to the new version, that may provide a lot of useful information about critical issues still left to fix.

Most importantly: **Make backups before opening any existing project in Godot 4.0 alpha builds.** There is no easy way back once a project has been (partially) converted.

## Downloads

The downloads for this dev snapshot can be found directly on our repository:

* [Standard build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.0/alpha17/) (GDScript, GDExtension).
* .NET 6 support should be included in 4.0 beta 1. The initial support has been merged, but more work is required to make official builds easily. For now, it's possible to compile it yourself from source, see [`modules/mono/README.md`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/modules/mono/README.md) for instructions.

## Known issues

As we are still in the alpha phase of development, there are still many issues to fix, some of which have already been reported and are being worked on.

See the GitHub issue tracker for a list of [known bugs in the 4.0 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.0+label%3Abug+).

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with 4.0 alpha 17. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

As in any major release there are going to be compatibility breaking changes. However, we still try to provide a migration path for your projects. If you experience a regression without a known migration path or workaround, do not hesitate to report it.
