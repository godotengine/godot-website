Another year, another showreel. As every year, the amount of quality games being created by Godot has increased significantly (as did the amount of submissions).

## Submissions

The idea of the reel is to include games both published and in development.

We got well over a hundred submissions this year, 3 or 4 more times than last year. Most of them are fantastic, but it became impossible to put all of them in the official reel, not even in the extended one.

After discussing, we decided to split into two, one for Mobile and one for Desktop/Console games, so have a seat, grab a drink and enjoy the 2019 showreels!

### Desktop / Console showreel

## Future

In some days we will also put up the extended showreel, including significantly more games.

As always, big thanks to [Hubert Lamontagne](https://soundcloud.com/madbr) for supplying music to the reel and to [Hugo Locurcio](https://twitter.com/hugolocurcio?lang=en) for the editing.

Remember that, as always, Godot is Open Source and community developed. The core contributors have decided to dedicate their lives to this project, rejecting very juicy offers by the biggest companies in the world. But this can only happen thanks to donations so, if you are not yet, please consider [becoming our patron](https://www.patreon.com/godotengine), and help Godot development remain free and open. Even a small donation is enormously helpful.
