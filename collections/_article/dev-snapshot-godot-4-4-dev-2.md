It's barely been a month since the [4.3 release](/releases/4.3/), but we had so many goodies queued up in the PR backlog that it's been an early Christmas (or other gift-heavy holiday season) for contributors and testers.

We merged more than 200 PRs for the [first dev snapshot](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-1/), and just two weeks later, here we are with another batch of 350+ improvements for you to test and provide feedback on!

Many of the changes in this release are bug fixes that will be backported to Godot 4.3 and released in 4.3.1! So please
test this release well so we can be confident with the changes and release 4.3.1 with them as soon as possible.

Keep in mind that while we try to make sure each dev snapshot is stable enough for general testing, this is by
definition a pre-release piece of software. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a version control system such as
Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also [try the **Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.4.dev2/) or the **Android editor** for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join [our testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds.

*The cover illustration is from* [**Megaloot**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2440380/Megaloot/), *an addictive inventory management roguelike, developed in Godot 4.3 by [axilirate](https://axilirate.itch.io/) and published by [Ravenage Games](https://x.com/Ravenage_games). It was recently released [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2440380/Megaloot/) with big success. You can follow the development on [Twitter](https://x.com/playmegaloot).*

## Highlights

In case you missed it, check the [4.4 dev 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-1/) release notes for an overview of some key features which were already in that snapshot, and are therefore still available for testing in dev 2.

This new snapshot adds a lot more features which had been queued during the stabilization phase for Godot 4.3, and were thus ready for merging early on in the 4.4 development cycle.

Introducing...

### Typed dictionaries!

Godot 4.0 introduced supported for typed arrays, but lacked support for typed dictionaries. This rapidly became one of the most requested features to add to the engine, and thanks to [Thaddeus Crews](https://github.com/Repiteo), it is now implemented for Godot 4.4! This feature impacts the core engine, GDScript, and all other scripting languages when interfacing with Godot's Dictionary type. You can now export typed dictionaries from scripts and benefit from a much improved Inspector UX to assign the right keys and values.

```gdscript
@export var typed_key_value: Dictionary[int, String] = { 1: "first value", 2: "second value", 3: "etc" }
@export var typed_key: Dictionary[int, Variant] = { 0: "any value", 10: 3.14, 100: null }
@export var typed_value: Dictionary[Variant, int] = { "any value": 0, 123: 456, null: -1 }
```

![Examples of typed dictionaries in the Inspector](/storage/blog/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-2/typed_dictionaries_inspector.webp)

As a related improvement, support for StringName dictionary keys has also been optimized by [Rune](https://github.com/rune-scape) ([GH-70096](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70096)).

### Error-less first project import

It is commonplace for Godot users using version control systems to exclude the `.godot` folder from their repositories, as it contains files which can be re-created by Godot the first time you edit the project.

One drawback of this system is that this first launch of the editor without `.godot` folder is typically quite noisy, with hundreds of errors spammed about missing resources, and various scripts failing to compile due to `class_name`s not being known yet, addons not being registered yet, or yet unknown GDExtension classes.

[Hilderin](https://github.com/Hilderin) valiantly fought their way through this labyrinth of dependencies and multi-threading pitfalls, and brought us back the long awaited grail: error-less first import of projects, which should work without requiring an editor restart! This took a lot of effort with [GH-92303](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92303) (for GDScript `class_name`s, included in 4.3) and now [GH-93972](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/93972) (for GDExtensions) and [GH-92667](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92667) (for plugins).

Moreover, with this newfound knowledge over the depths of `EditorFileSystem`, Hilderin also further improved that first project import experience to make the FileSystem dock more responsive while resources are being scanned ([GH-93064](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/93064)).

### Editor window state is now persistent

Another long-awaited quality of life improvement was implemented by [Samuele Panzeri](https://github.com/spanzeri) in [GH-76085](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76085), adding support for keeping track of the editor window's state (fullscreen/windowed mode, screen, size, position) to restore it across sessions. This should be particularly welcome for users with big monitors or multi-monitor setups who want a different default behavior than fullscreen on the first screen.

### Visual shader goodies

A few popular quality of life improvements have been implemented by [Yuri Rubinsky](https://github.com/Chaosus) for the visual shader editor:

New material preview side dock ([GH-94215](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/94215)):

![Material preview in the visual shader editor](/storage/blog/dev-snapshot-godot-4-4-dev-2/visual_shader_material_preview.gif)

Drag & drop of Mesh to create MeshEmitter in visual shaders ([GH-93017](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/93017)):

### Initial Android editor support for XR devices

Thanks to Godot's unique feature of having an editor made with the engine itself, we've been able to bring the Godot editor to unconventional places, such as [the web](https://editor.godotengine.org/) and [Android devices](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.godotengine.editor.v4). Building upon the latter, [Fredia Huya-Kouadio](https://github.com/m4gr3d) completed the proof of concept started by [Bastiaan Olij](https://github.com/BastiaanOlij) years ago, to add support for using the Android editor in an XR context using OpenXR ([GH-96624](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/96624))! You can [test the current version](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-builds/releases/download/4.4-dev2/Godot_v4.4-dev2_android_editor_horizonos.apk) by sideloading the APK, currently supported on Meta Quest 3 or Quest Pro.

## Known issues

- Typed dictionaries: Different typed keys/values are wrongly allowed when using the `[]` operator ([GH-96772](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/96772)). A fix is already in the pipeline for the next dev snapshot.
- Windows: Detecting newly added assets ([GH-96828](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/96828)), export variables ([GH-96810](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/96810)), and the last modification dates for projects ([GH-96812](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/96812)) is not working in this snapshot, due to a toolchain bug exposed by a recent FileAccess change on Windows. This was already fixed by [GH-74830](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/74830).

With every release we accept that there are going to be various issues, which have already been reported but haven't been fixed yet. See the GitHub issue tracker for a complete list of [known bugs](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+).

## Bug reports

As a tester, we encourage you to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in this snapshot).
