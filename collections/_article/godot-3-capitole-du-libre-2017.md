We will be at the [Capitole du Libre](https://2017.capitoledulibre.org/) this week-end with [Julian Murgia](https://github.com/StraToN) and [Gilles Roudière](https://github.com/groud). It's one of the largest French events dedicated to Free Software, and it's taking place in Toulouse.

We will have a stand during the two days where you can chat with us about Godot, play games and buy gorgeous Godot T-Shirts. We will host a Godot 3 **game creation workshop** on Sunday 19/11 starting at 10:30, based on [KidsCanCode's intro to Godot tutorial](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/learning/step_by_step/your_first_game.html).

## Godot 3 presentation

I'm also giving a **conference dedicated to Godot 3**, on Saturday 18/11, from 15:00 to 16:00.

The presentation itself is made in Godot. It's going to be open source and available to the entire community. This way if you want to give a talk anywhere in the world, you don't have to start from scratch. Although it's in French, it's designed to be easy to translate.

The event is **completely free to attend**. There will be a lot of developers, artists and FOSS game creation enthusiasts. If you want to meet, feel free to ping us on social media.

We hope to see you there!
In the meantime, have a pleasant day.
