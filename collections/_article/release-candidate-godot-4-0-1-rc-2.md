The first patch release of Godot 4 is almost ready. Following on the heels of [the biggest release in the history of Godot](/article/godot-4-0-sets-sail), 4.0.1 is focused on the most critical issues, as well as smaller usability improvements that we can fit with confidence they will not introduce any new problems and regressions. A couple of days ago we released the first Release Candidate, and it's already the time for another preview, with the stable release being just around the corner.

Please give it a try if you can. It should be safe to migrate your existing projects to 4.0.1, but to make sure of that we need your help testing the changes. If there are no significant regressions reported with release candidates, a stable version is going to be published soon. Don't forget to always make backups when moving versions, even minor. Better yet, prefer using a version control system, such as Git, and commit a version of your project before the migration.

## Highlights

This release candidate includes some changes which may interest a lot of users:

- You can no longer create new projects in non-empty folders, as well as your OS-specific user/home folder. We also removed the ability to delete local files when removing a project from the project list ([GH-74974](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/74964)).
  - Both of these functionalities are situationally useful, but also create many opportunities for undesirable side-effects. We had several reports from users accidentally creating projects in their home directory and making the editor import everything stored there, as well as others who accidentally deleted their entire user directory. This makes these functionalities too dangerous to leave as is, and we would prefer to revisit them when we can make a better UI that prevents such accidents.
