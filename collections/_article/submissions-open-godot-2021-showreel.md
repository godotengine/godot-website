Does your Godot-made game or tool (published or work in progress) make you proud? Would you like to showcase it in the upcoming 2021 showreel? Please send us a short video of it!

### Submission process

The submission process has changed for this year. Unlike previous years (where we were completely overwhelmed by the amount of entries), we now have a showreel app. As it allows sorting and categorizing the entries, this app greatly helps the selection process done by several main contributors. Thanks to [groud](https://github.com/groud) for developing it! This showreel app is [open source](https://github.com/groud/godot-showreel-voting).

- Create an account and log in to the [Godot Showreel App](https://showreel.godotengine.org/).
  - You can use a GitHub, Discord, etc. account to log in as well.
  - If you already have an account on the [Godot Contributors Chat](https://chat.godotengine.org/), you can reuse the credentials as they use a shared <abbr title="Single Sign-On">SSO</abbr> solution.
- Carefully read the submission guidelines on the **About** tab at the top (this includes more information about the video requirements).

~~**Submissions close on July 1st 2021 at 23:59 UTC!**~~

**Deadline has been extended: Submissions close on July 5st 2021 at 23:59 UTC!**
