Godot 4.1 is celebrating its [3 month anniversary](/article/godot-4-1-is-here) this week, and that means Godot 4.2 is entering the beta testing phase shortly after. This development cycle has been packed with bugfixes and other improvements. As always, we take the safest of these contributions and we compile them into a patch release for the current stable version of the engine.

Such is the case of Godot 4.1.2, which is officially available starting today! Engine contributors provided fixes for almost every area of the engine, so make sure to read the changelog [below](#changes). Here's a short summary of some of the more interesting changes.

- A number of performance issues have been addressed in rendering ([GH-80070](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/80070), [GH-80407](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/80407)), GUI ([GH-79325](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/79325), [GH-80857](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/80857)), and engine core ([GH-81037](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/81037)). The latter fix should also improve the memory profile of the engine if you instance a lot of plain objects.

- Another series of changes in rendering squashes a variety of conditions for crashes, and improves the visuals by fixing glitches ([GH-80485](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/80485), [GH-79660](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/79660)) and removing leaks when using the lightmapper on Vulkan ([GH-81872](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/81872)).

- A previously reported issue with Steam Input and gamepads causing some input events to be doubled is addressed by 4.1.2 ([GH-76045](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76045)). This issue affects the Linux platform, which means it's a very welcome fix for all Steam Deck developers and users.

- Another critical platform-specific bug has been identified for the web platform, with file system operations failing and causing issues for developers and users of Godot's own online editor. It is now fixed ([GH-79866](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/79866)), which means you can once again save your projects while working on the web.

- As many game developers compile Godot and its custom forks by themselves, it's important for us to ensure buildsystem stability and flexibility as well as that of the rest of the engine — even for previous releases. This version includes fixes to XCode 15 compatibility ([GH-82458](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/82458)), a number of changes reducing build times ([GH-80612](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/80612), [GH-80482](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/80482), [GH-81144](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/81144)), as well as Visual Studio and MSVC quality-of-life improvements ([GH-79238](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/79238)).

## Known incompatibilities

*Edited on October 11, 2023.*

One regression was identified for iOS export when using Xcode 14 or earlier ([GH-83085](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/83085)), caused by a fix to support the new Xcode 15.
The regression fix ([GH-83088](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/83088)) was applied directly to the export templates archive, so users who downloaded 4.1.2 export templates prior to October 11, 2023 should re-download them if they intend to export projects to iOS with Xcode 14 or earlier.

Aside from the above, there are no known incompatibilities with the Godot 4.1 release. **We encourage all users to upgrade to 4.1.2.**

If you experience any unexpected behavior change in your projects after upgrading to 4.1.2, please [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues).
