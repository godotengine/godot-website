It's finally time for some extensive testing of the upcoming Godot 3.4 release, which is already quite feature-packed a mere 3 months after the [3.3 release](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-3-3-has-arrived)!

And you read correctly, this is 3.4 **beta 2**, even though we never had a formal beta 1 announcement on this blog. [3.4 beta 1 is available for download](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.4/beta1/) for comparison purposes, but since it had a major regression on [C# support on Windows](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/50486), I skipped its blog post...

... which gave me some more time to go through the huge changelog and list some of the main changes below! There's still more I want to add over coming days, but there's no reason to delay the publication of the beta 2 builds.

As usual, you can try it live with the [**online version of the Godot editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/3.4.beta2/godot.tools.html) updated for this release.

## Highlights

The main changes coming in Godot 3.4 and included in this beta are:

- C#: iOS and Apple Silicon fixes ([GH-49248](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/49248)).
  * iOS: Fix `P/Invoke` symbols being stripped by the linker. This would often result in a `EntryPointNotFoundException` crash at runtime.

All these need to be thoroughly tested to ensure that they work as intended in the upcoming 3.4-stable.

## Downloads

The download links for dev snapshots are not featured on the [Download](/download) page to avoid confusion for new users. Instead, browse our download repository and fetch the editor binary that matches your platform:

- [Standard build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.4/beta2/) (GDScript, GDNative, VisualScript).
- [Mono build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.4/beta2/mono/) (C# support + all the above). You need to have dotnet CLI or MSBuild installed to use the Mono build. Relevant parts of Mono **6.12.0.147** are included in this build.

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with 3.4 beta 2. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in 3.3.2 or earlier no longer works in 3.4 beta 2).
