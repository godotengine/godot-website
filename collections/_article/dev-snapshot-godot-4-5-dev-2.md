With the [4.4 release](/releases/4.4/) a little over a month ago, one might've expected content updates to trickle out slowly for our initial 4.5 development snapshots. â€¦Well, maybe not after seeing the [4.5 dev 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-5-dev-1/) snapshot, but **surely** they couldn't follow that up with another flood of anticipated changes, right?

You fools. You underestimate the passion of our community yet again, as **250** improvements are ready to roll for this snapshot. What's more is that, unlike last time, we're not *just* in bugfix territory any more. Now the time for proper enhancements and features entirely unique to this development cycle has come, and this blogpost will aim to highlight them to the best of our ability. As always: with new features comes new bugs (probably), so the sooner we can get feedback and bug reports in, the better.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also [try the **Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.5.dev2/) or the **Android editor** for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join [our testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds.

It is developed by [Binogure Studio](https://www.binogure-studio.com/).

## Highlights

In case you missed them, see the [4.5 dev 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-5-dev-1/) release notes for an overview of some key features which were already in that snapshot, and are therefore still available for testing in dev 2.

### Dedicated 2D navigation server

For the longest time, the navigation server was a unified beast. 3D and 2D, Yin and Yang, two sides of the same coin. While beautiful on a philosophical level and undoubtedly a heart-wrenching screenplay waiting to happen, it was a pretty sour deal for the 2D side of things. Previously, if you were making a 2D game and wanted to make use of navigational features, you were effectively locked into a bunch of 3D settings and features that would never see any use but would *absolutely* see a bump in output size.

Steps have been taken during this initial 4.5 period to ensure that navigation logic is more cleanly divided and organized, spearheaded by our navigation guru [smix8](https://github.com/smix8), but none of this could've been possible without cleanly splitting the navigation server in twain. Longtime contributor [AThousandShips](https://github.com/AThousandShips) took the mantle on this project, and she successfully accomplished this goal with [GH-101504](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/101504). From now on, users will be able to selectively enable/disable the navigation modules for 2D and/or 3D, instead of being forced into an all-or-nothing ultimatum.

### Reorganized shader editor UI

The editor experience for shaders and visual shaders got some <abbr title="Tender loving care">TLC</abbr> in [GH-100287](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/100287). Helmed by [Yuri Rubinsky](https://github.com/Chaosus), this PR provides several requested features and QOL updates to our shading friends. Below is a preview image taken directly from the PR in question, where you'll find more information on what to expect when you get your hands on it this snapshot.

### Changing editor language without restart

Godot has built-in support for handling multiple languages, both for the games you create and the editor itself. However, in contrast to games built with the engine, it wasn't possible to change the current language on-the-fly within the editor itself. Our editor expert [Tomasz Chabora](https://github.com/KoBeWi) addressed this issue in [GH-102562](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/102562), ensuring that users can swap to their preferred language within the same editor session! While this is somewhat niche in practice, our stance on convenience and accessibility is one that we take very seriously, and a seamless/streamlined editor experience is exactly the sort of thing we want as many users as possible to enjoy.

### Fragment density map support

When rendering for VR headsets, the pixels around the outside of the viewport are less important, because they will be somewhat distorted by the lens, and players will tend to turn their head rather than move their eyes too far from the center.

Godot already supports using the Vulkan "Fragment Shading Rate" extension to render the outside of the viewport at a lower resolution, leading to performance improvements with little noticeable decrease in quality. However, on standalone VR headsets (like the Meta Quest), this extension either isn't supported, or doesn't provide as big performance improvements as the Vulkan "Fragment Density Map" extension.

In [GH-99551](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99551), rendering expert [DarioSamo](https://github.com/DarioSamo) has implemented support for the "Fragment Density Map" extension, making the Vulkan Mobile renderer more viable for VR on standalone headsets.

### Wayland: Native sub-window support

Thanks to the tireless efforts of [Riteo](https://github.com/Riteo), the X11 alternative [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) has been given first-class treatment on Godot. It's been a long road to stand as an equal to such a dominant display server protocol, but it's getting closer with every passing PR; though some have been hesitant to make the change for one reason: lack of native sub-windows. Taking on this hurdle for parity was no small feat, but it was a requirement for supporting embedded game windows on Wayland, so ([GH-101774](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/101774)) made it happen all the same:
