Development is well under way for our next milestone, Godot 4.2. After our [dev 2 snapshot](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-2-dev-2/), we kept merging new features and important bug fixes, and gathered quite a number of them — so now we're ready for the third dev snapshot to put those under broader user testing. It's been around a month since we started this release cycle, with roughly two months to go until 4.2 beta 1, and then another month to reach stable in early November 2023.

I'd like to outline the amazing work done by the [Production team](https://godotengine.org/teams/#production), and especially by Yuri Sizov, who took care of PR reviews, merges, and the whole release process while I was on holiday in the second half of July. Godot 4.1.1, the first two dev snapshots for 4.2, and 4.0.4 — all were fully handled by Yuri. While I used to be the only one responsible for making and publishing releases, we're now fully sharing the role of release manager. That should enable us to keep this sustained pace with a high quality standard.

Back to today's development snapshot, here are some of the highlights of 4.2 dev 3, with a bigger list available [below](#whats-new):

- Initial support for C# on Android has been merged ([GH-73257](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/73257))! It's still a work in progress, with caveats outlined in the PR, and we haven't had time to look into what it takes to provide official Android export templates for the .NET build. So at this time you'll have to try compiling templates from source and provide feedback on what works and what doesn't.

- The long-awaited 2D HDR rendering is now implemented ([GH-80215](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/80215)). This makes it possible to use 3D effects such as glow in 2D games, and can be used to substantially improve quality of 2D rendering at the cost of performance. Use the `rendering/viewport/hdr_2d` project setting to enable HDR in 2D. Note: this setting only has an effect when using the Forward+ or Mobile rendering methods.

- More rendering goodies have been merged, such as ShaderRD compilation groups ([GH-79606](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/79606)), the ability to call code on the render thread ([GH-79696](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/79696)), and performance fixes around depth prepass ([GH-80070](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/80070)).

- A lot of work is happening behind the scene around Viewport mouse handling, starting with [GH-67791](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/67791) and numerous follow-ups for platform-specific adjustments. You may expect some instability while we take note of and iron out the consequence of these changes, so be sure to report any crash or improper mouse/GUI behavior in this build.

- A very popular feature proposal was implemented to improve the editing of box collision shapes ([GH-71092](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71092)), allowing to extend the box size one face at a time.

- Alongside bugfixing, some optimization work is being done on GDScript, starting with operators ([GH-79990](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/79990)).

Keep in mind that while we try to make sure each dev snapshot is stable enough for general testing, this is by definition a pre-release piece of software. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.
