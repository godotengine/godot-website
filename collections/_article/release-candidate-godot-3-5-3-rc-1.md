It's been a while since our [previous maintenance release for Godot 3](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-5-2/)! While the development focus is on the Godot 4 branches, we're still making steady progress towards the Godot 3.6 feature release, currently in [beta phase](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-3-6-beta-3/). But we also need occasional updates to the current 3.5 branch which is used in production by many.

The main purpose of this release is to provide updated Android export templates which target API level 33 (Android 13), which is a requirement for new apps and updates on Google Play [since August 2023](https://developer.android.com/google/play/requirements/target-sdk). It also includes a number of other platform-specific fixes which may be relevant for published games, notably around gamepad input and audio.

Please give it a try if you can. It should be as safe to use as 3.5.2-stable is, but we still need a significant number of users to try it out and report how it goes to make sure that the few changes in this update are working as intended and not introducing new regressions.
