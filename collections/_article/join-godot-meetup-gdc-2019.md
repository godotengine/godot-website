As mentioned [last week](/article/meet-godot-representatives-gdc-2019), several core developers and project representatives will be at the [Game Developers Conference](https://gdconf.com) (GDC) in San Francisco next month.

Like last year, our friends at [GitHub](https://github.com) provide us with the awesome opportunity to organize a Godot Meetup at their headquarters during GDC!

We'll meet on **Thursday, March 21 at 6:30 pm** at the GitHub HQ for an evening of Godot talks, games showcase and general networking for everyone interested in Godot Engine. Whether you're an active Godot user and just curious about it, you are welcome to come to the Godot Meetup and get to meet other community members.

The entrance is free, but you have to **[sign up](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/godot-gdc-meetup-2019-tickets-57554184114)** as soon as possible on **[Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/godot-gdc-meetup-2019-tickets-57554184114)**, so that we can finish the organization with GitHub staff.

See our [Events page](/events) for further details.

We're looking forward to meeting you in San Francisco :)
