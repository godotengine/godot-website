The development phase for Godot 4.1 is well under way, still aiming for the [stable release by the end of June / early July](/article/release-management-4-1/). We had a [first dev snapshot](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-1-dev-1/) a few weeks ago, and it's now time for the second one.

This build includes a number of big PRs which you might want to test specifically:

- 2D: Add proper snapping to tile polygon editor ([GH-70488](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70488)).
- 3D: Fixes to CSG robustness ([GH-74771](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/74771)).
- Core: Prevent errors when using ViewportTexture ([GH-75751](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/75751)).
- GDScript: Improve GDScript documentation generation & behavior ([GH-72095](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72095)).
- GDScript: Add support for static variables in GDScript ([GH-76264](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76264)).
- GUI: Add support for multiline cells to `Tree` ([GH-61714](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/61714)).
- Network: Redo how the remote filesystem works ([GH-76540](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76540)).
- Porting: Android: Allow concurrent buffering and dispatch of input events ([GH-76399](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76399)).
- Rendering: Fix voxel GI issues ([GH-76437](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76437), [GH-76550](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76550)).

- Shaders: Add shader cache to GLES3 ([GH-76092](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76092)).

A lot of work is also being done to improve the Android editor port. We just created a separate Play Store release for the Godot 4.1 dev snapshots, so that interested users can test it easily and provide us with feedback and automated reports on potential issues. [You can join the testing group here to get access.](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers)
