The upcoming **Godot 3.6** is now considered feature complete, and has received a lot of bugfixes and improvements over the past weeks thanks to all the testers and developers who reported and fixed issues. We are now at the [**Release Candidate**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate) stage, finalizing everything so that we can release 3.6-stable for all users.

At this stage we need people to test this release (and potential follow-up RCs) on as many projects as possible, to make sure that we catch non-obvious regressions that might have gone unnoticed until now. If you run into any issue, please make sure to [report it on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) so that we can know about it and fix it!

As a reminder, this is a feature update to the Godot 3.x branch, which means it's only relevant for users currently using Godot 3.5 or 3.6-beta. Projects made with Godot 4.x cannot be downgraded to Godot 3. While most of the engine development focus is on Godot 4.3, some dedicated contributors still allocate some time to finalizing 3.6 for the many users who still have games in production using Godot 3.

This RC 1 has a number of fixes since beta 5, including:

- Fix scene shader regression ([GH-92070](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92070))
- Fix `merge_meshes()` functionality ([GH-92105](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92105))
- Fix pausing behaviour with physics interpolation ([GH-93382](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/93382))
- Fix 2D skinning with physics interpolation ([GH-93309](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/93309))
- Fix viewport behaviour with physics interpolation ([GH-92152](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92152))
- Fix text to speech loaded too early ([GH-92261](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92261))
- Fix physics tick counter ([GH-92941](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92941))
- Faster editor grid ([GH-92725](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92725))
