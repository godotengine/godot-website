While our main focus stays on the 4.0 branch, the current stable 3.2 branch is receiving a lot of great improvements, and the upcoming 3.2.4 release is going to be packed with many new features.

With this **beta 6** build, there are several recently merged changes that will require heavy testing to be stabilized before 3.2.4-stable:

- [New CPU lightmapper](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44628) using Embree for raytracing and OIDN for denoising.
  * Note: It's currently not available for macOS ARM64 as the libraries used are specific to x86_64. We hope to be able to solve that eventually. On Apple M1 devices, you can use the x86_64 version in the "universal" binary with Rosetta to test the new lightmapper.
- [New dynamic <abbr title="Bounding Volume Hierarchy">BVH</abbr>](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44901) for rendering and the GodotPhysics backends, which should fix some issues and improve performance significantly in games using a high number of dynamic objects.
  * The previous Octree-based system is still available, though the dynamic BVH is meant to replace it once all potential issues are ironed out. In this beta, the dynamic BVH is the default option for both physics and rendering. You can revert back either of them to octree in the [Project Settings](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44901#issuecomment-758618531).
  * The Bullet physics backend already used its own dynamic BVH implementation, it's not affected by this change.
- [Multiple fixes to one-way collisions](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/42574), handling many cases where collisions would not work reliably.
- [iOS plugins support](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/41340), with a similar interface to Android plugins.
  * See [godot-docs#4213](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/pull/4213) for the updated documentation.
- [New `AspectRatioContainer` Control node](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/45129) to easily set up UIs that should respect a given aspect ratio.

Please report any issue regarding either of those changes, so that we can iron out potential issues quickly and release 3.2.4-stable.

- [Configurable amount of lights per object](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/43606), now defaulting to 32 instead of 8.
- [macOS ARM64 support](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/39788) in official binaries for Apple M1 chip (only classical build for now).

## Downloads

The download links for dev snapshots are not featured on the [Download](/download) page to avoid confusion for new users. Instead, browse our download repository and fetch the editor binary that matches your platform:

- [Standard build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2.4/beta6/) (GDScript, GDNative, VisualScript).
- [Mono build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2.4/beta6/mono/) (C# support + all the above). You need to have MSBuild installed to use the Mono build. Relevant parts of Mono 6.12.0.114 are included in this build.

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with 3.2.4 beta 6. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in 3.2.3 or earlier no longer works in 3.2.4 beta 6).
