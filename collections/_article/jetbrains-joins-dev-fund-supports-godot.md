We would like to welcome JetBrains as a Platinum Sponsor of the Godot Foundation. The support from JetBrains means a lot to us, so we would love to thank them for enabling us to keep improving the engine for everyone. 

If you’re not already familiar with JetBrains, they build great developer tools, with some very helpful game development-facing features. JetBrains Rider is a must-have IDE and code editor for GDScript, C#, and C++, with specific support for various different game engines, including Godot. As well as rich editing and <kbd>Ctrl + Click</kbd> navigation, there are smart features like Find Usages, Rename (no more find/replace!) and specific inspections and quick fixes to help with best practices while writing, debugging or testing code for your game. Check out [their page for more details](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/rider-godot/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rider&utm_content=godot-page-blog).

### Free for non-commercial use

While JetBrains Rider is known as a professional tool, it recently became available for free for non-commercial use. That means if you’re just getting started with Godot, then it’s free for learning. It’s also free for open source, so you can use it to contribute to the engine, and it’s free for content creation, so you can make cool videos of your learning journey too. Other options for [licensing](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/buy/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rider&utm_content=godot-licensing&section=commercial&billing=yearly) and [discounts](https://www.jetbrains.com/store/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rider&utm_content=godot-post-discounts&section=discounts&billing=yearly) are also available.

### A message from JetBrains:

At JetBrains, we value the diversity of thought and experience in the software industry, such as the many different programming languages and related ecosystems. We can see that there is ample scope for multiple game engines, especially so for a not-for-profit, open-source game engine. Development happens thanks to the dedication of contributors and paid volunteers, and we welcome the chance to support passionate people making a difference with a successful community project.

We’d like to encourage you to visit the [Godot Development Fund](https://fund.godotengine.org/) platform managed by the [Godot Foundation](https://godot.foundation/), or to check [out the alternative ways to donate](https://godotengine.org/donate), and join us in supporting such a fantastic project.
