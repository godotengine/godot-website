After a short end-of-year break, and then a lot of heavy merging work prior to [4.0 beta 11](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-11), we found a lot of regressions – as we expected!

Our contributors could fix many of the new regressions quickly, and we merged another big batch of important fixes and improvements. As the pace intensifies in the lead-up to the first Release Candidate, we decided to make more frequent beta snapshots for testing.

This beta includes a few big changes which may interest a lot of users:

- Regression fix for a major GDScript issue that could lead to seemingly random crashes (e.g. when dealing with PackedArrays) which many beta 11 users experienced ([GH-71228](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71228)).
- A lot more GDScript fixes and improvements! See the list below.
- A refactor of Animation APIs to change the `stop(reset: bool)` to two separate `stop()` and `pause()` methods ([GH-71218](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71218)), as was heavily requested by the community.
- A couple fixes to the text resource loader which could impact notably reloading scripts ([GH-71170](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71170)).
- Fix Tab key usage in the inspector ([GH-71271](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71271)).
- Add expand modes to TextureRect ([GH-58517](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/58517)).
- OBJ mesh import now supports vertex colors as exported by Blender ([GH-71033](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/71033)).
- New NavigationServer performance monitor ([GH-70731](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70731)).
- Physics fixes and improvements for sphere-capsule, sphere-box, sphere-cylinder, and capsule-cylinder collisions ([GH-70660](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70660), [GH-70787](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/70787)).
- As always, a bunch of nice rendering fixes! See the list below.

## What's new

If you're interested in an overview of what's new in Godot 4.0 beta in general, have a look at the detailed release notes for [4.0 beta 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-1). In this blog post, we will only cover the main changes since the previous beta release.

See the [**changelog on GitHub**](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/compare/91713ced81792b10fdc9367b7f355738e5d52777...3c9bf4bc210a8e6a208f30ca59de4d4d7e18c04d), or the [**list of merged PRs**](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2023-01-10T16%3A00..2023-01-13T10%3A00+is%3Amerged+sort%3Acreated-asc+milestone%3A4.0), for an overview of all changes since 4.0 beta 11 (76 commits – excluding merge commits ― from 39 contributors).

While we do our best to minimize compatibility breaking changes for existing beta users, there are still occasional changes in the API which may impact your Godot 4 projects. See the list of PRs with the [`breaks compat` label](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2023-01-10T16%3A00..2023-01-13T10%3A00+is%3Amerged+sort%3Acreated-asc+milestone%3A4.0+label%3A%22breaks+compat%22) for details.

## Known issues

As we are still in the early beta phase of development, there are still many issues to fix, some of which have already been reported and are being worked on. See the GitHub issue tracker for a list of [known bugs in the 4.0 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.0+label%3Abug+).

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

As in any major release there are going to be compatibility breaking changes. However, we still try to provide a migration path for your projects. If you experience a regression without a known migration path or workaround, do not hesitate to report it.
