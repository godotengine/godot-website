Many core team members are heading to the Game Developers Conference next week (see our [past announcement](/article/godot-at-gdc-2024/), and the [line-up of games](/article/gdc-2024-godot-games/) we'll be showcasing), and preparing for this event in parallel to working on the upcoming Godot 4.3 release has kept us really busy!

So maintenance releases for 4.1 and 4.2 users fell through the cracks temporarily, but we're getting back on track with a new set of release candidates for both 4.1.4 and 4.2.2.

Since the previous [RC 1 snapshots](/article/release-candidate-godot-4-1-4-and-4-2-2-rc-1/), we've merged a lot of additional important bug fixes, which warrant a good amount of testing. So please give it a try on your projects, and let us know if you run into any problem!

Maintenance releases are expected to be safe for an upgrade, but we recommend to always make backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give the new releases a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements. You can also try the **Web editor** ([**4.1.4 RC 2**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.1.4.rc2/), [**4.2.2 RC 2**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.2.2.rc2/)) or the **Android editor** for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join [our testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds.
