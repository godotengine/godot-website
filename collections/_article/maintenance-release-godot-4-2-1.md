We released [Godot 4.2](/article/godot-4-2-arrives-in-style/) two weeks ago, with major improvements and bug fixes all around the engine. Like any big feature release, it had a few rough edges which we've been focusing on addressing in the past couple of weeks. This allows us to already publish this first maintenance release, Godot 4.2.1, which irons out some of those issues while fully preserving compatibility.

Some of the most important fixes in this release are:

- For the GL Compatibility renderer on macOS, we switched from the Metal ANGLE backend back to native OpenGL drivers. Our hope was that ANGLE's Metal backend would make the Compatibility renderer future proof (as Apple deprecated their native OpenGL support), and fix some known driver bugs with OpenGL drivers on macOS. It turns out that ANGLE's Metal backend brings more issues than it solves, so we rolled back that change of default backend ([GH-85785](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85785)).

- Still on macOS, the new iOS one click deploy feature requires Xcode to be installed, and would use `xcode-select` to check that when the editor starts. This could trigger an install dialog that would make Godot appear frozen, without making the issue explicit to users. We switched to use `mdfind` to check if Xcode is installed, which should solve this issue ([GH-85774](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85774)).

- A number of bugs have been solved for the Vulkan renderers on Android, which could cause crashes or corrupted meshes ([GH-84852](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/84852)). This might also have solved issues with garbled tilemap rendering on some Android devices, though we still need confirmation on that.

- Many users of the [Godot Jolt](https://github.com/godot-jolt/godot-jolt/) addon in 4.1 experienced the editor crashing when upgrading their project to 4.2, due to a bug in older versions of Godot Jolt which made it incompatible with Godot 4.2. Given how widespread the issue seems to be, we decided to add a hack for Godot Jolt specifically to prevent loading older versions which are known incompatible with Godot 4.2 ([GH-85779](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85779)). After successfully loading a project with Godot Jolt disabled, you should delete the old version you have installed, and reinstall the latest version (0.11.0 at the time of writing) which is compatible with Godot 4.2.

- A regression with handling of TileMap occluders was also fixed ([GH-85893](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85893)).

- Recent Emscripten releases changed their default stack size, which caused issues for Web export in Godot 4.2 when using certain APIs. We added the needed linker flags to restore the behavior from older Emscripten versions, ensuring that Godot can run successfully after being compiled by the latest Emscripten releases ([GH-86036](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/86036)).
