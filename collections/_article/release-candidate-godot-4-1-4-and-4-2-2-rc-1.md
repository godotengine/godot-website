While we are [staying firmly on track](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-3-dev-2) with the upcoming **Godot 4.3** release, previous versions continue to receive patches and fixes to ensure that you have the best possible experience, should you choose to remain using them.

Godot's development practices make each release an iteration on the previous one, which allows us to relatively easy cherry-pick and backport many critical improvements without fear of regression and broken compatibility. Thanks to this environment today we can try something new, and publish two release candidates simultaneously, offering an upgrade for both **Godot 4.1** and **Godot 4.2** users.

Both versions have received a number of stability and performance improvements, as well as corrections and polish to documentation. You will find notable changes in their respective highlight sections below.

Maintenance releases are expected to be safe for an upgrade, but we recommend to always make backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give the new releases a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements. You can also try the **Web editor** ([**4.1.4 RC 1**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.1.4.rc1/), [**4.2.2 RC 1**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.2.2.rc1/)) or the **Android editor** for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join [our testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds.
