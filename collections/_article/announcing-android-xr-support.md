With the recent public release of Samsung Galaxy XR, the first headset using the new Android XR operating system, we are pleased to announce that Godot already supports this new ecosystem.

As a game engine that puts OpenXR front and center, Godot is uniquely positioned to excel on this platform.

With the release of the [Godot OpenXR vendor plugin v4.2.0](https://store-beta.godotengine.org/asset/godot-xr/godot-openxr-vendors-plugin/), a new option for Android XR has been added that allows developers using [Godot 4.5 and newer](https://godotengine.org/download/) to effortlessly export their existing projects to this new platform.

The Godot XR Editor has also been updated with Android XR support and runs beautifully on this new device. Users can download the Godot XR Editor from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.godotengine.editor.v4).

W4 Games has [announced their support of the platform](https://www.w4games.com/blog/w4-games-news-1/w4-games-works-with-the-androidxr-team-and-the-godot-foundation-to-improve-godots-android-xr-support-123) including implementing various vendor specific extensions that expose functionality unique to Android XR.

As part of this initiative, W4 Games will be making a donation to the Godot Foundation to ensure supporting Android XR long term and continue their work on enhancing Godot's OpenXR support.
