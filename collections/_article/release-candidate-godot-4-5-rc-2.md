On Friday of last week, we dropped our first [Release Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate) build. As a reminder, we release RC builds once we _think_ the engine has stabilized and is ready for release. It is your last chance to report critical regressions before we release the stable version. Now, not even a full week later, we're ready with our second snapshot. This RC2 fixes the last of the critical regressions that we are aware of. Unless someone reports a new regression coming from the changes made in RC1 or RC2, we should be on track to release 4.5 stable soon.

At this point in the process you will see the activity on GitHub slow down as we avoid merging work for 4.5. Our focus in the coming days will be on preparing the release, and queuing up all the changes we would like to merge early in the 4.6 release cycle.

Please consider [supporting the project financially](#support), if you are able. Godot is maintained by the efforts of volunteers and a small team of paid contributors. Your donations go towards sponsoring their work and ensuring they can dedicate their undivided attention to the needs of the project.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also try the [**Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.5.rc2/), the [**XR editor**](https://www.meta.com/s/h9JcJGHfg), or the [**Android editor**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.godotengine.editor.v4) for this release.

## Highlights

For an overview of what's new overall in Godot 4.5, have a look at the highlights for [4.5 beta 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-5-beta-1/), which cover a lot of the changes. This blog post only covers the changes between RC 1 and RC 2. This section covers all changes made since the [RC 1 snapshot](/article/release-candidate-godot-4-5-rc-1/), which are largely regression fixes:

## Known issues

During the Release Candidate stage, we focus exclusively on solving showstopping regressions (i.e. something that worked in a previous release is now broken, without workaround). You can have a look at our current [list of regressions and significant issues](https://github.com/orgs/godotengine/projects/61) which we aim to address before releasing 4.5. This list is dynamic and will be updated if we discover new showstopping issues after more users start testing the RC snapshots.

With every release, we accept that there are going to be various issues which have already been reported but haven't been fixed yet. See the GitHub issue tracker for a complete list of [known bugs](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug).

## Bug reports

As a tester, we encourage you to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in this snapshot).
