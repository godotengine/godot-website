We're working towards finalizing the feature set for 4.0 beta, reviewing many PRs which have been opened prior to our roadmap [feature freeze](/article/godot-4-0-development-enters-feature-freeze) announced a month ago. While this process is ongoing, we'll keep releasing alpha builds so here's **4.0 alpha 16**! Same deal as usual, lots of bugs fixed and more refactoring and feature work.

Some noteworthy changes in this release:

- Re-enable support for Web exports using the OpenGL 3 / WebGL 2 renderer.
  * This is the first alpha to include export templates for the Web platform again. The Web editor build is not functional yet.
- Implement MSAA for 2D with Vulkan.
- Implement physical light units in Vulkan renderers.
- Implement navigation links via `NavigationLink2D`/`3D` nodes.
- Re-enable per-pixel transparency support on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Lots of fixes to theme propagation issues, both regressions in the previous alpha 15 and pre-existing bugs that it helped uncover. And various editor theme improvements.
- Core: More renames!
  * The beta feature freeze will soon lock the API more or less in place, so contributors have been hard at work evaluating and merging or rejecting the last proposals for a more consistent and user-friendly API.
  * For users of previous alphas, we don't always have compatibility code to ease transition. If you run into upgrade issues that you can't solve easily, please let us know so we can consider how much inter-alpha compatibility code we need to add.

Be aware that during the alpha stage the engine is still not feature-complete or stable. **There will likely be breaking changes between this release and the first [*beta* release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta).** Only the beta will mark the so-called "feature freeze".

As such, we do not recommend porting existing projects to this and other upcoming alpha releases unless you are prepared to do it again to fix future incompatibilities. However, if you can port some existing projects and demos to the new version, that may provide a lot of useful information about critical issues still left to fix.

Most importantly: **Make backups before opening any existing project in Godot 4.0 alpha builds.** There is no easy way back once a project has been (partially) converted.

## Downloads

The downloads for this dev snapshot can be found directly on our repository:

* [Standard build](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.0/alpha16/) (GDScript, GDExtension).
* .NET 6 support should be included in 4.0 beta 1. The initial support has been merged, but more work is required to make official builds easily. For now, it's possible to compile it yourself from source, see [`modules/mono/README.md`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/modules/mono/README.md) for instructions.

## Known issues

As we are still in the alpha phase of development, there are still many issues to fix, some of which have already been reported and are being worked on.

See the GitHub issue tracker for a list of [known bugs in the 4.0 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.0+label%3Abug+).

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with 4.0 alpha 16. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

As in any major release there are going to be compatibility breaking changes. However, we still try to provide a migration path for your projects. If you experience a regression without a known migration path or workaround, do not hesitate to report it.
