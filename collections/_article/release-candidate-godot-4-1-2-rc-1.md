We have had quite a pause since [Godot 4.1.1](/article/maintenance-release-godot-4-1-1) — two months without a new patch release (blame the summer break!). So it's long overdue we have one, starting of course with a release candidate to validate that everything is in order and no new changes introduce regressions.

Godot 4.1.2 contains a number of stability improvements, addressing crashes related to threading, editor features, networking, GUI, and rendering. A significant bug related to allocations of plain objects has been fixed as well, which should improve performance and memory usage, especially at scale ([GH-81037](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/81037)). There are also a number of performance fixes in GUI nodes, such as `Tree` and `RichTextLabel`, which make parts of the editor UI more responsive ([GH-79325](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/79325), [GH-80857](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/80857)). Several optimizations have been made to rendering backends as well.

We have received reports of issues with saving projects on the web platform, and this release resolves these issues ([GH-79866](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/79866)), as well as a few other platform-specific bugs. Another important problem fixed in 4.1.2 is doubled input events coming from gamepads when using Steam Input ([GH-76045](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76045)). And as always there is a bunch of smaller, but no less crucial changes and updates!

Maintenance releases are expected to be safe for an upgrade, but we recommend to always make backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.
