We [released Godot 3.3 a few weeks ago](/article/godot-3-3-has-arrived), and feedback so far has been pretty good! But like with any major milestone, there are some bugs which are worth addressing with low-risk maintenance releases to further improve the experience for all Godot users.

The upcoming Godot 3.3.1, [like all future 3.3.x releases](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.3/about/release_policy.html), focuses purely on bug fixes, and aims to preserve compatibility. This [Release Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate) should help us validate the fixes done so far, and ensure that the release is ready to publish.

As there is no new feature and only bug fixes, this RC 2 should be as stable as 3.3-stable and can be used in production if you need one of the fixes it includes. If all goes well with this RC 2, the stable build should come early next week.

As usual, you can try it live with the [**online version of the Godot editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/3.3.1.rc2/godot.tools.html) updated for this release.
