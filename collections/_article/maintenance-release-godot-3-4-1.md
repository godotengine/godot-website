title: "Maintenance release: Godot 3.4.1"
excerpt: "Godot 3.4.1 is the first maintenance release in the 3.4 stable branch, fixing a number of issues (including some 3.4 regressions) while preserving compatibility with 3.4-stable. Alongside general bugfixing, it improves Godot's compatibility with Windows 11's new Windows Terminal, which prevented starting the Godot editor from the project manager."

[Godot 3.4](/article/godot-3-4-is-released) was released a month ago, and it went fairly smoothly! Many thanks to all the contributors who worked on it, including all testers who tried beta and RC releases to ensure that the 3.4-stable branch would be an easy and worthwhile upgrade path for all users.

No software release is perfect though, so there will always be some things to iron out, which is why we provide maintenance releases for stable branches, focusing on bugfixing and preserving compatibility (see our [release policy](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.4/about/release_policy.html)). Godot 3.4.1 is the first maintenance release in the 3.4 stable branch, and a **recommended upgrade for all Godot 3.4 users**.

[**Download Godot 3.4.1 now**](/download) or try the [online version of the Godot editor](https://editor.godotengine.org/3.4.1.stable/).

## Known incompatibilities

*Edit 2021-12-22:* One regression has been found which causes flickering on macOS (affects both using the editor on macOS, and games exported to macOS). All users are advised to upgrade to [Godot 3.4.2](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-4-2) which fixes that issue.
