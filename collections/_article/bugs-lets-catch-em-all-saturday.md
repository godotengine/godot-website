title: "Bugs: Let's catch 'em all this Saturday 9 December"
excerpt: "Both testers and developers are doing a great job, but we need to go ever faster to get Godot 3.0 out as soon as possible - especially now that the master branch is in feature freeze, meaning that new features will have to wait for Godot 3.1 to be merged.

We propose to have a special bug hunting day on Saturday, 9 December, to focus on fixing the bugs reported for the 3.0 milestone. Testers are also encouraged to use this opportunity to file new bug reports, after checking existing issues for potential duplicates."

Since our [Godot 3.0 beta 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-3-0-beta-1) release last week, there have been [more than 70 bugs fixed](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+closed%3A2017-11-29..2017-12-08+-label%3Aarchived) and over 100 bug reports created!

Both testers and developers are doing a great job, but we need to go ever faster to get Godot 3.0 out as soon as possible - especially now that the *master* branch is in feature freeze, meaning that new features will have to wait for Godot 3.1 to be merged.

## Bug hunting day on Saturday 9 December

We propose to have a special bug hunting day tomorrow (Saturday 9 December), to focus on fixing the bugs reported for the 3.0 milestone. Testers are also encouraged to use this opportunity to file new bug reports, after checking existing issues for potential duplicates.

### How does it work?

Join us on the developers' IRC channel ([#godotengine-devel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#godotengine-devel) on Freenode, also accessible from Matrix) to discuss issues and potential fixes live, and pick any bug in the [3.0 milestone](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/milestone/4) to try to fix it. To avoid potential conflicts/duplicated work, add a comment in the relevant issue to state that you are working on it.

If you don't know which issue to start with, check the [Hero Wanted!](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22hero+wanted%21%22) selection which lists bugs with useful debugging information and/or some hints about how to fix them.

The event will start as soon as someone is awake in the channel on Saturday (our contributors from Asia and Australia will get to start :)), and will continue for the whole day over the globe's timezones.

You're free to join for one hour or for the whole day, the important is that we fix issues and get to know each other at the same time. There should always be plenty of experienced devs around to help you get started if you are not very familiar with Godot's source code.
