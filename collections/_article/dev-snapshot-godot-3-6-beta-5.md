It has been a while since our last beta, and admittedly 3.6 seems to have been in development *for ever* (beta 1 was over a year ago!).

There are fewer developers now working on 3.x branch, and RÃ©mi's time has been largely monopolized by the huge growth in contributors to 4.x, and the consequent increase in his workload. For this reason we have been trying to get maintainers more actively involved in release management, which is allowing enthusiasts to take on more of the work, and get everything running in a more efficient manner.

This is great news for Godot 3, as it means in the future we will more efficiently be able to address bugs, improve performance, and add new features, to keep Godot 4's baby brother as a force to be reckoned with.

This beta represents *feature freeze* for 3.6. We will now concentrate on bug fixing until we reach stable. Any new features will be scheduled for 3.7.

## Highlights

It's been a while since the previous beta snapshot, so we wouldn't be surprised if you're not fully up-to-date on what are the most exciting changes going from Godot 3.5 to the current 3.6 beta. This beta 5 blog post focuses on changes since beta 4, so have a look at previous beta blog posts for a more complete overview of what's new ([beta 1](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-3-6-beta-1/), [beta 2](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-3-6-beta-2/), [beta 3](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-3-6-beta-3/), [beta 4](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-3-6-beta-4/)).

For a complete overview of the changes, see our [**interactive changelog**](https://godotengine.github.io/godot-interactive-changelog/#3.6).

Previous snapshots contained many 2D features, and this beta 5 adds a number of 3D features so there should be something for everyone:

### Tighter Shadow Culling ([GH-84745](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/84745))

Godot shadow mapping involves taking a simplified camera shot from the point of view of each shadow casting light, when objects move within this light volume. This happens every frame when objects are moving, and this can add up to a lot of drawcalls for each light.

Tighter shadow culling reduces this workload considerably by eliminating drawcalls for shadow casters that cannot cast a shadow upon the main camera view. This involves some clever geometry, but the upshot is you should often see significantly better frame rates when using shadows.

This happens automatically.

### Discrete Level of Detail (LOD) ([GH-85437](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85437))

![LOD node example](/storage/blog/godot-3.6/lod_node_scene.webp)

The new LOD node provides simple but powerful LOD capabilities, allowing the engine to automatically change visual representation of objects based on the distance from the camera. An example would be simplifying trees in the distance in open world games.

### Mesh Merging ([GH-61568](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/61568))

![MergeGroup example](/storage/blog/godot-3.6/merge_group_house.webp)

Godot 3.6 now offers a comprehensive system for mesh merging, both at design time and at runtime. OpenGL can be severely bottlenecked by drawcalls and state changes when drawing lots of objects. Now you can blast through these barriers and potentially render any number of similar objects in a single drawcall.

As well as allowing you to optimize existing maps and moving objects, this also makes new procedural game types possible, as thousands of procedurally placed objects can be merged at runtime so as to render efficiently (think vegetation, rocks, furniture, houses, etc.).

See the [MergeGroups documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.6/tutorials/3d/merge_groups.html) for details.

### ORM Materials ([GH-76023](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76023))

Ansraer adds support for ORM materials, which is a standard format where occlusion, roughness, and metallic are combined into a single texture. This means these standard PBR textures can be used without modification, and rendering performance will likely be increased where they are used (compared to the old workflow).

### Vertex cache optimization ([GH-86339](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/86339))

In the mesh import options (e.g. obj, gltf, dae) you will find a new setting for "vertex cache optimization". This may increase rendering performance for high poly models on low-end hardware.

In order to take advantage of vertex cache optimization in an already completed project, simply delete the hidden `.godot` folder (which contains imported data), and this imported data (including optimized meshes) will be recreated next time you open the editor.

### 2D fixes

Fixes to physics interpolation, and hierarchical culling, as well as performance increases.

### View Selected Mesh Stats ([GH-88207](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/88207))

![View mesh stats example](/storage/blog/godot-3.6/view_mesh_stats.webp)

The 3D view menu now offers a new (long overdue) option, "View Selected Mesh Stats". This will display total triangle, vertex, and index counts for the selected meshes (and multimeshes).

This is incredibly useful information for diagnosing performance and checking imported meshes, and use in conjunction with mesh merging and LOD.

### SceneTree dock's filter improvements ([GH-67347](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/67347))

Now supports multiple terms, filter by type or group.
