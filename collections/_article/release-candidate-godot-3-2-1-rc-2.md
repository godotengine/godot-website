Time flies and it's already close to two weeks since our [first release candidate](/article/release-candidate-godot-3-2-1-rc-2) for the upcoming Godot 3.2.1, which will be a maintenance update focusing on bug fixes for [Godot 3.2](/article/here-comes-godot-3-2) users.
I planned to have 3.2.1-stable already released by now, but I was sidetracked by the [refactoring work](/article/core-refactoring-progress-report-1) which is happening in the `master` branch for Godot 4.0 :-)

Since RC 1, a couple regressions have been fixed, and a few additional bug fixes, documentation updates and usability enhancements have been included. We now publish **Godot 3.2.1 RC 2** to validate those additional changes. [53 new commits](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/compare/1bc1939c63e07c6a03dbb258d765e0f450559706...ea2e976cdd7b8516e881d7ed4588e66601add315) have been cherry-picked to the `3.2` branch, for a total of [171 commits](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/compare/3.2-stable...ea2e976cdd7b8516e881d7ed4588e66601add315) since the `3.2-stable` release.
