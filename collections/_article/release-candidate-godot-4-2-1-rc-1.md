We released [Godot 4.2](/article/godot-4-2-arrives-in-style/) one week ago! If you missed that lengthy but informative blog post, [do check it out](/article/godot-4-2-arrives-in-style/) to get an overview of what's new in this feature update, and join us in celebrating the accomplishment of all Godot contributors!

Since the release, we naturally got a massive influx of users upgrading to Godot 4.2, which surfaced some regressions which hadn't been found during the beta and release candidate phase. This isn't a surprise, as a community project with QA testing exclusively done by volunteers, it's hard for the beta testers to cover all potential scenarios where a change might [break someone's workflow](https://xkcd.com/1172/). If you'd like to help, be sure to test dev/beta snapshots and release candidates regularly while we work on the next feature release, and report any unexpected behavior in your projects.

But overall Godot 4.2 seems to be doing well, and we've already managed to fix a number of the most important issues that users ran into with that release. So it's time for a release candidate for 4.2.1, which will be the first maintenance series in that branch. Please give it a try, and let us know if the fixes listed below actually solve issues you might have encountered when upgrading to 4.2.

We've highlighted (in bold) some of the main changes that might solve showstopping issues some users ran into.

Maintenance releases are expected to be safe for an upgrade, but we recommend to always make backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also [try the **Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.2.1.rc1/) or the **Android editor** for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join [our testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds.

  * It's not obvious from the commit, but this should fix freezes that some macOS users have been experiencing when opening Godot if they don't have Xcode installed.
- GDExtension: Fix updating cached singletons when reloading GDScripts ([GH-85373](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85373)).
- **GDExtension: Fix crash when using incompatible versions of Godot Jolt ([GH-85779](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85779)).**
  * We knew that old versions of Jolt were crashing in Godot 4.2, but we underestimated how widely used Jolt is, and the fact that it's difficult for users to keep their addons up-to-date with the current Asset Library. So we added a small hack to prevent loading older Jolt versions to avoid that crash. To use Jolt in Godot 4.2, be sure to update it to [0.11.0-stable](https://github.com/godot-jolt/godot-jolt/releases/tag/v0.11.0-stable).

- Navigation: Fix NavigationRegion2D transform update ([GH-85258](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85258)).

- **Rendering: Vulkan: Fix incorrect access to the buffers on Android ([GH-84852](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/84852)).**
  * This should fix a lot of issues with 3D meshes on Android when using the Vulkan backend (Mobile or Forward+). It's not a regression fix, but a fairly significant one for Android users.
- Rendering: Use vertex input mask for creating vertex arrays ([GH-85092](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85092)).

- **Rendering: macOS: Switch ANGLE backend to ANGLE over OpenGL, switch default compatibility renderer back to native ([GH-85785](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85785)).**
  * Reports from 4.2 users made it clear, the Metal backend for ANGLE isn't as performant as we hoped. It brings more issues (even on recent Mac devices) than the current obsoleted native OpenGL drivers, so we switch back to native OpenGL for the Compatibility renderer on macOS.
- Shaders: Automatically ensure correct normals in Compatibility renderer ([GH-82804](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/82804)).
- Shaders: Comment the shader template light function by default ([GH-84594](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/84594)).
- XR: Remove unused grip touch action from default OpenXR action map ([GH-85048](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85048)).
