**Edit (2016-04-11 20:44 CEST):** New binaries were uploaded for the 2.0.2 release to [include a late fix](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/e8a0b2462b11528838ad5890f2146a84a9e70f93) for a bug causing a memory overflow on some platforms, notably iOS.

As mentioned in [an earlier announcement](article/updates-on-the-release-cycle-and-godot-2-0-1), while working on our future major version 2.1, we intend to provide maintenance releases every once in a while for the currently supported version (branch 2.0).

So one month after the release of Godot 2.0.1, [here's version 2.0.2](/download) with some non-critical bug fixes and some usability improvements. [Grab it now!](/download)

## Distribution changes

### OpenSSL temporarily disabled

Godot uses OpenSSL for HTTPS support in its networking API. For easier binary distribution, most official binaries were linked against an embedded copy of OpenSSL; however this one being somewhat old and thus vulnerable to various security issues, we chose to build the 2.0.2 binaries without OpenSSL support.

This is a temporary solution to work around the warnings you might be getting on Google Play or the Apple Store about security vulnerabilities in your binary. The better solution for future releases will be to update our embedded OpenSSL copy to the latest upstream release (cf. [issue 2780](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2780)).

If your game requires OpenSSL support, you can either:

- Keep using version 2.0.1 which was built with OpenSSL support
- Build binaries yourself with `openssl=builtin` (built-in version) or `openssl=yes` (system shared library)

### Uncompressed binaries

We used to compress official binaries with [UPX](http://upx.sourceforge.net), a nice tool that generates small binaries with little decompression overhead. However, this tool is unmaintained since 2013 and has only experimental support for 64-bit Windows, and no support for 64-bit OSX and some other platforms. It has also been known to cause various issues on Windows with antivirus software, and might be related to a couple other bugs.

So for this release, we decided to distribute uncompressed binaries and see how it goes. If you liked having small binaries to distribute, you can still use UPX yourself on your export templates or exported binaries; we will put together some documentation about which templates can be safely compressed, and how to do it (in the meantime you can refer to [UPX's website](http://upx.sourceforge.net) for instructions).

## Engine changes
