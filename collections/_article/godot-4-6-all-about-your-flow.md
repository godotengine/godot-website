With the stability gained over the past five releases, the engine has matured enough to enter a new phase. Godot 4.6 kicks off a period of polish, quality-of-life improvements, and doubled-down effort on performance optimization.

The result: a release that puts you and your workflow first.

Here are a few highlights to whet your appetite:

The new Modern editor theme puts the viewport center stage with clean lines and reduced clutter (you can switch back to Classic if you prefer). Jolt Physics is now the default for 3D projects after proving itself production-ready. Docks are now flexible and floatable, so you can arrange the editor your way. Inverse Kinematics (IK) is back with a completely new framework of solvers and constraints. Screen Space Reflections got a major overhaul for better visuals and performance.

And that's just scratching the surface.

Close to 400 contributors authored 2,001 commits for this release. Every aspect of the workflow, including speed and comfort when editing scenes, authoring and exporting, or profiling and debugging, received some love to keep you focused on creating and minimize time spent wrestling with UI.
