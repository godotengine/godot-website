[Godot 3.6](/article/godot-3-6-finally-released) was released in September last year, and it has been mostly stable, although there have been a few more important bugs which warrant a maintenance "patch" release (3.6.x).

As well as bug fixes, this release also contains some cherry-picks from 4.x to update libraries. Let us know if you spot any regressions.

As usual, you can try it live with the [**online version of the Godot editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/3.6.1/) updated for this release.

## Major bugs fixed

### Grid snapping + ruler in editor
A small change to `Range::set_value` unfortunately led to a major regression in grid and ruler behaviour when zoomed in ([GH-98466](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/98466)).

We decided on balance the safest course of action in 3.x was to revert the change.

- GUI: Revert changes to `Range::set_value` ([GH-100459](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/100459)).

### Performance regression due to directional shadow fade_start

Users noticed a drop in performance in 3D scenes with DirectionalLight in Godot 3.6 compared to 3.5. We tracked this down to the introduction of the `fade_start` property, which made some changes to the shader.

We were able to fix this up with some modifications.

- Rendering: Ameliorate performance regression due to directional shadow `fade_start` ([GH-99536](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/99536)).

## Changelog

**21 contributors** submitted around **45 fixes** for this release. See our [**interactive changelog**](https://godotengine.github.io/godot-interactive-changelog/#3.6.1) for the complete list of changes since the 3.6 release.

This release is built from commit [`b1ba98fce`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/b1ba98fced19ac05b7a39b64a97dd7b1005cb7bb).

## Downloads

{% include articles/download_card.html version="3.6.1" release="stable" article=page %}
**Standard build** includes support for GDScript, GDNative, and VisualScript.
**.NET build** (marked as `mono`) includes support for C#, as well as GDScript, GDNative, and VisualScript.

### UWP (Universal Windows Platform)

Unfortunately after hitting some build snags with UWP, we've taken the difficult decision to drop it from the pre-built release templates. Current demand seems very low (one of the last remaining use cases was UWP builds with Xbox One) and UWP has already been dropped for Godot 4.x. Note that it is still supported via compiling from source with MSVC.

## Bug reports

As a tester, you are encouraged to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with 3.6.1. Please check first the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not known already.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in 3.6 or earlier 3.5.x releases no longer works in 3.6.1).

## Support

Godot is a non-profit, open source game engine developed by hundreds of contributors on their free time, and a handful of part or full-time developers, hired thanks to [donations from the Godot community](/donate). A big thankyou to everyone who has contributed [their time](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/AUTHORS.md) or [financial support](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/DONORS.md) to the project!
