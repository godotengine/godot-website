Like we announced [a while ago](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-at-gdc-2024/), the team is preparing to head over to the US for this yearâ€™s GDC! In case you have not heard about the conference before, you can read more about it here: [gdconf.com](https://gdconf.com/)

We will have a booth on the expo floor, and would love to welcome you there! You can play games (more about those below), chat with [our sponsors](https://w4games.com/2024/01/31/dive-into-the-godot-ecosystem-at-gdc-2024/), meet contributors to the engine and ask your burning questions to the Foundation members staffing the place. There might even be pins to snatch up ðŸ‘€

## Meetup at GitHub HQ

You can meet us in San Francisco even if you donâ€™t hold a GDC ticket. For the third time, our friends at GitHub have lent us their space to host a small after-hours get-together. There will not be talks or a formal program, the focus lies on meeting fellow Godot developers and chatting about your games.

Register for the event [here](https://lu.ma/zymqufq0). There are **limited spots**, so please tell us if you donâ€™t end up making it.


## Games made with Godot

Just like last year, we invited Godot developers to join us on our travels and exhibit their games at our booth. Check out the list below, and schedule some time for live playtesting when you are around! On the 21st of March, we will be joined by a senior class of students from a local public school. As part of their Game Design Academy program - which was started 15 years ago - the teams are currently developing games for their final presentations. At our booth, they will present their current prototypes and aim to gather some feedback from industry veterans.
