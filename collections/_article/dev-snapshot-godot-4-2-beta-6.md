The 4.2 stable release is drawing near, as the list of known critical regressions is shrinking every day.

This 6th beta fixes a number of showstopper regressions via some relatively core changes. Those will need thorough testing to ensure that we're not introducing other issues that would prevent users from moving from Godot 4.1 to 4.2. Please pay specific attention to those changes and ensure that they do not cause issues in your projects:

- C#: Add `NOTIFICATION_PREDELETE_CLEANUP` notification to fix C# `Dispose()` ([GH-83670](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/83670)).
- Core: Make languages bookkeeping thread-safe ([GH-84657](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/84657)).
  * We're already aware of one issue affecting the C# editor caused by this PR ([see below](#known-issues)) - please let us know if you spot anything else that changed behavior, especially in GDExtension language bindings.
- GDScript: Fix lambda cross-thread dynamics ([GH-84659](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/84659)).
- GUI/Input: Make mouse enter/exit notifications match mouse events ([GH-84547](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/84547)).
  * This should restore the expected behavior for `mouse_entered` and `mouse_exited` signals. If you had noticed any weird change in mouse events in your projects in earlier betas, please make sure to test this beta 6 and confirm if your bugs are properly fixed.
- Input: Rework input actions to be reliable ([GH-84685](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/84685)).
  * Godot 4.2 fixes an infamous bug affecting actions with multiple input methods assigned to them ([GH-45628](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/45628)), but that fix relied on getting proper information from the OS about which key events are repeated (echo). It turns out that some OSes ([GH-82262](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/82262)) and browsers ([GH-82732](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/82732)) don't properly report this information, so we had to take another stab at refactoring this input handling. We need it tested thoroughly, especially on projects supporting using multiple event types at the same time.

## Known issues

We're currently tracking issues that we consider release blockers very closely. The main remaining ones that we're aware of are below:

- Following [GH-84657](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/84657), the .NET-enabled Godot editor seems to get stuck on exit ([GH-84728](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/84728)). We're working on solving this for the next build.
- If you use both Godot 4.1 and 4.2 as self-contained with separate caches, you may run into this edge case: [GH-84732](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/84732). Deleting the `.godot` folder and doing a clean import with Godot 4.2 should work around this problem.

If you run into any other showstopper while testing this beta, please make sure that it's reported and reproducible, and let us know if you think we may have missed prioritizing it.

With every release we accept that there are going to be various issues, which have already been reported but haven't been fixed yet. See the GitHub issue tracker for a complete list of [known bugs](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+).

## Bug reports

As a tester, we encourage you to [open bug reports](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) if you experience issues with this release. Please check the [existing issues on GitHub](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) first, using the search function with relevant keywords, to ensure that the bug you experience is not already known.

In particular, any change that would cause a regression in your projects is very important to report (e.g. if something that worked fine in previous 4.x releases, but no longer works in this beta).

## Support

Godot is a non-profit, open source game engine developed by hundreds of contributors on their free time, as well as a handful of part or full-time developers hired thanks to [generous donations from the Godot community](https://fund.godotengine.org/). A big thank you to everyone who has contributed [their time](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/AUTHORS.md) or [their financial support](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/DONORS.md) to the project!
