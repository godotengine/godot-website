Hi! Nathan here.

I got hired by the Godot team to work part-time mission to help improve the official documentation. The job involves the following tasks:

1. **Auditing the documentation** to find missing, low-quality, and outdated content.
2. Improving the **content's organization**.
3. Triaging issues.
3. **Solidifying the workflow** for core contributors and writing content guidelines.
4. Removing outdated content.
5. Improving the getting started guide.

Note that I will be working on the [godot-docs repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/) and specifically on the reference manual; not on the class reference (although I took some extra time to review pending pull requests for the code reference).

All my work is **public and open to feedback**, entirely done on GitHub. This contract already stems from a [public proposal](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/issues/3390) to improve the manual by the time Godot 4.0 comes out. We had a long discussion with users and core contributors there, leading to this project.

Any changes to the content will only affect the `latest` version of the online manual, that is to say, the future Godot 4.0 docs. So you won't see the changes in the `stable` version of the documentation until the Godot 4.0 release.

You can learn more in a [video presentation](https://youtu.be/eBQSkGdG8zA) of this project.

I've already gotten to work, starting with the [audit](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/issues/3969) and reviewing pull requests. To get progress report on this project periodically, you can [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NathanGDQuest). Alternatively, you can [watch the godot-docs repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/) to get notified of all new issues and pull requests.

This project was funded by a generous donor who asked for work to be done specifically on the documentation.
