2021 is quickly approaching and in the Godot community we are starting to prepare for next year's GodotCon!

As you might know, each year we attend FOSDEM, the major Free and Open Source event in Europe, and we use the opportunity to organise our own small conference as a fringe event: GodotCon! A meetup for contributors, users and interested people to socialize, collaborate and share knowledge.

Sadly, given the uncertainty regarding international travel and the possibility to host big gatherings, FOSDEM has decided to go online-only for next year's edition and we are taking the same decision for our own GodotCon.

It's not all bad news because as much as we'll miss meeting each other in person, we must see it as an opportunity for everyone to participate, no matter where they are located.

# So, what's the plan?

**Online GodotCon 2021** will happen on the **23rd of January** (the weekend before the Global Game Jam ;)) and will consist of a video stream with pre-recorded talks and a community platform to host chat and Q&A.

We decided to go for pre-recorded event as this will be our first fully online event and we would like to simplify its technical complexity so everyone has the best experience. This will also make it more comfortable for users to present if GodotCon is happening at an impractical time for their timezone.

We are preparing a way for users to submit questions for the presenter to answer, we will share more info on this topic closer to the event.

As usual for Godot events, Online GodotCon 2021 will be **free of charge**, and the video streams will be available to replay after the event. More precise details on the streaming and chat platforms, as well as start and end time, will be announced in coming weeks.

# Call for participation

Over the coming weeks, we encourage anyone interested to send us proposals for talks, workshops or any other idea you would like to host. GodotCon is an event made by Godot users, so we need you to propose content that will make it a great event for all attendees.

We are interested in any Godot-related topic. It can be a talk about your own Godot project, the tricks you're using in your workflow, a specific feature or plugin that you developed in the engine, etc. We'd like to have diverse speakers and topics, so if you're using Godot for non-gaming topics (education, research, non-game apps, etc.), you're also very welcome to share this with the community. Basically, feel free to propose anything that you think could be worth sharing with fellow Godot users and/or contributors.

As an indication, we propose a duration of 20 minutes (+ 5-10 min Q&A) for talks, though you can tell us if you'd prefer a different format. A 5 min presentation of your game would be welcome, and a 40 min talk is fine too if the topic is worth it :)

Please send your proposals to godotcon *at* godotengine *·* org with the following information:

* Type (talk, tutorial, live demo… anything you think would be fun to see)
* Title
* Abstract (short description of what it will be about)
* Preferred communication method (for us to contact you)

Don't overthink the above too much, we'd prefer to know ASAP who may give a talk, and we can fill in more details later on.

For inspiration, feel free to review the schedules of past events for a glimpse at the kind of activities that we usually have ([Brussels 2019](/article/schedule-godotcon-2019-brussels), [Poznań 2019](/article/schedule-godotcon-2019-poznan), [Brussels 2020](/article/schedule-godotcon-2020-brussels)).

We will schedule the event as soon as possible and get back to you if we accept your presentation so you can start working on it. Please, try to send your proposals **before the 31st of December** so there is plenty of time to schedule and prepare it.

# More questions?

For any other questions, please, don't hesitate to write to that same mail (godotcon *at* godotengine *·* org) and the GodotCon team (Aina, Ilaria, Julian, and Wojciech) will try to solve your doubts.

Thanks everyone and we hope to see you at our first Online GodotCon 2021!
