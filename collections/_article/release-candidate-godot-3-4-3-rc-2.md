In parallel to our work on Godot 3.5 ([with a first beta](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-3-5-beta-1)) and 4.0 ([now at alpha 2!](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-alpha-2)), we backport important fixes to the stable 3.4 branch for use in production.

A number of such fixes have been queued since the [3.4.2 release](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-4-2), so we're getting ready to release Godot 3.4.3, and this second [Release Candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate) is your chance to help us validate it.
