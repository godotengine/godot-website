4.3 dev 5 is following quickly behind 4.3 dev 4 since we want to get something into your hands before we head over to the [Game Developers Conference](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-at-gdc-2024/) next week. Please test out this development release and give us lots of feedback, so that we can enter the beta phase shortly after we return!

Importantly, you will notice the development pace slow a little bit as many of the core developers are away for the week and taking a much needed vacation the following week.

Keep in mind that while we try to make sure each dev snapshot is stable enough for general testing, this is by definition a pre-release piece of software. Be sure to make frequent backups, or use a version control system such as Git, to preserve your projects in case of corruption or data loss.

[Jump to the **Downloads** section](#downloads), and give it a spin right now, or continue reading to learn more about improvements in this release. You can also [try the **Web editor**](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/4.3.dev5/) or the **Android editor** for this release. If you are interested in the latter, please request to join [our testing group](https://groups.google.com/g/godot-testers) to get access to pre-release builds.

*The cover illustration is from* [**Béton Sanglant**](https://mreliptik.itch.io/beton-sanglant), *a fast paced arena FPS where you need to survive waves of enemies. It is developed by [MrEliptik](https://twitter.com/mreliptik). While the game is still a work in progress, you can download it now on [itch.io](https://mreliptik.itch.io/beton-sanglant).*

## Highlights

As a reminder, this section only covers changes made since the previous [4.3 dev 4 snapshot](/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-3-dev-4/). For a more comprehensive overview of what's new in Godot 4.3 compared to 4.2, you'll have to wait for the first beta release, or refer to our [interactive changelog](https://godotengine.github.io/godot-interactive-changelog/#4.3).

Here are just a few of the exciting changes that have come in the last couple of weeks!

- 2D: Add new Parallax2D node ([GH-87391](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/87391)). This supersedes the current ParallaxLayer/ParallaxBackground nodes and removes many limitations that we had with them. You can even convert ParallaxLayers and ParallaxBackgrounds into Parallax2D nodes conveniently in the editor. Going forward we recommend always using Parallax2D for your parallax needs. We think that the Parallax2D does everything that ParallaxLayer/ParallaxBackground could do and more! If you find something that ParallaxLayer/ParallaxBackground can do that Parallax2D can't, please let us know as soon as possible.
- Animation: Add multi-selection for SpriteFrames editor ([GH-85494](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/85494)).
- Audio: Add interactive music support ([GH-64488](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/64488)). This feature was 5 years in the making, starting with the work of Daniel Matarov during [GSoC 2019](/article/gsoc-2019-progress-report-3/#interactive-music), continued by Juan Linietsky in 2022, and finalized this year!
- Audio: Fix audio crackling issues on Windows using certain DACs due to incorrect WASAPI buffer size ([GH-89283](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/89283)).

- Core: Merge `uid_cache.bin` and `global_script_class_cache.cfg` after mounting PCKs ([GH-82084](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/82084)).
- Editor: Automatically create folder in project manager create and import ([GH-56420](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/56420)).

- GDScript: Add `@export_custom` annotation ([GH-72912](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72912)).
- GDScript: Allow `@exported` Arrays to set property hints for their elements ([GH-82952](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/82952)).
- GDScript: Allow LSP to process multiple messages per poll ([GH-89284](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/89284)).
- GUI: Fix mouse entered notifications ([GH-88992](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/88992)).
- Import: Add "skip file" import option to skip (and exclude from export) importable formats ([GH-87972](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/87972)).
- Linux: Wayland: Restore tablet support and handle multiple tools ([GH-88744](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/88744)).

- Particles: Fix early activation of particle trail sections ([GH-89042](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/89042)).
- Rendering: Fix Volumetric Fog VoxelGI updates ([GH-86023](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/86023)).
