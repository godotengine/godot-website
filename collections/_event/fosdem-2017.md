<p>
	<a href="https://fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a> stands for Free and Open Source Developers' European Meeting and is
	held every year in February at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in Brussels, Belgium.
	It is arguably the biggest European event about free and open source software, with free entry and thousands
	of developers and users of various projects attending.
</p>

<h4>Godot stand (with goodies!)</h4>

<p>
	This year will be Godot's first official participation with a
	<a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/stands/">Godot&nbsp;Engine stand</a>. It will be located in Building H
	(<a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/buildings/#h">Campus plan</a>).
	We invite all Godot users and contributors from Europe and beyond to join us there and help us man the stand,
	distribute goodies and talk to the other visitors about our engine.
</p>

<p>
	Want to help us with the stand, designing or ordering goodies and stand material (table cloth, kakemono,
	etc.)? Get in touch with us on <a href="/community">one of the community channels</a> (especially IRC ;)).
</p>

<h4>Escoria talk in the Open Game Development track</h4>

<p>
	Julian Murgia (StraToN) and Rémi Verschelde (Akien) will be giving a
	<a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/ogd_escoria/">25 min talk about Godot and particularly
	Escoria</a>, the Godot-based open source framework for point'n'click adventure games
	<a href="/article/our-point-click-framework-finally-out">that was released recently</a>. For those who can't
	attend, the talk should be recorded by FOSDEM volunteers and available online as soon as possible (can take a
	few weeks though).
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Date:</strong> Sunday, Feb 5 @ 16:30</li>
	<li><strong>Location:</strong> Room AW1.126 (come early, places are limited)</li>
	<li><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/ogd_escoria/">FOSDEM abstract</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Meeting the community</h4>

<p>
	The primary purpose for many of us will be to meet each other in person after having worked for months or
	even years together online.
	We will have plenty of time to grab some Belgian beers together, and maybe organize a community dinner
	together on Saturday evening.
</p>
