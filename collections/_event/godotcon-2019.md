<p>
	Like the past two years, we're taking the opportunity that many community members flock to Brussels for
	<a href="#fosdem-2019">FOSDEM 2019</a> to organize our own <em>Godot Conference</em> right after it. There
	will be talks and workshops given by engine users and developers, and plenty of time to discuss with each
	other and play Godot-made games.
</p>

<p>A Call for Proposals will be posted soon, and speakers will be announced in late December or January.</p>

<p>
	This is an event for you (and us) to meet together and get to strengthen the existing bonds between Godot
	contributors and users. Everyone is welcome to join, and the entrance will be free. Even if you aren't
	familiar with Godot&nbsp;Engine yet, this can be a nice opportunity to discover a great game engine and
	an even greater community!
