<p>
	As many contributors are already gathering for the <a href="#godotsprint-2023">Godot Sprint</a>, we
	are taking the opportunity and organizing a Godot User Meeting. It will be great opportunity to meet
	some engine developers and other users. Feel free to bring a demo of your game if you would like to
	share! This will not be the only Godot user Meeting in 2023, so don't worry if you can't make it.
</p>

<p>Entrance will be free.</p>
