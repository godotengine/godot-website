gamescom is a trade fair for video games held annually at the Koelnmesse in Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia. It is the world's largest gaming event (measured by exhibition space and number of visitors), with 370,000 visitors and 1037 exhibitors from 56 countries attending the show in 2018.

We'll be at the Godot booth in the Business Area, Hall 2.2, Stand C-042.

Thanks to [Ramatak](https://ramatak.com/) and [W4 Games](https://w4games.com/) who are donating it, the Godot Engine will have a booth. This is an excellent opportunity to meet us, and like-minded folks. Come hang out around the booth and get some free swag!
