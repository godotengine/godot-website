The official GodotCon returns to Europe and this time, it will be the first GodotCon in the city where the Godot Foundation calls home. For this edition of the event, we teamed up with the [Dutch Games Association](https://dutchgamesassociation.nl/) to help us organize it and make sure that everything runs smoothly.
