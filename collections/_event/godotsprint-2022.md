<p>
	The two days before <a href="#godotmeeting-2022">Godot User Meeting 2022</a>, we organize what we call the
	Godot Sprint, with the intent for contributors to meet IRL and <em>get some work done</em>! This contributor
	sprint will be primarily intended for existing engine and documentation contributors, so that we can work on
	current topics together, review Pull Requests, discuss the roadmap, etc. We will also welcome users who aren't
	contributors yet but would like to get involved, be it with C++ engine contributions, documentation writing or
	the creation of other teaching materials (demos, courses, etc.). <strong>More information
	<a href="/article/godot-sprint-and-user-meeting-barcelona-june-2022">here</a></strong>
</p>

<p>Entrance will be free.</p>
