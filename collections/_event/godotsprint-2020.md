<p>
	The two days before <a href="#fosdem">FOSDEM 2020</a> and <a href="#godotcon">GodotCon</a>, we organize what
	we call the Godot Sprint, with the intent for contributors to meet IRL and <em>get some work done</em>! This
	contributor sprint will be primarily intended for existing engine and documentation contributors, so that we
	can work on current topics together, review Pull Requests, discuss the roadmap, etc. We will also welcome users
	who aren't contributors yet but would like to get involved, be it with C++ engine contributions, documentation
	writing or the creation of other teaching materials (demos, courses, etc.).
</p>

<p>Entrance will be free.</p>
