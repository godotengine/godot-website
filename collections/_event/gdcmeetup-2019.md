<p>
	Like last year, Godot developers are going to GDC in San Francisco, and we're using the opportunity to have a
	Godot GDC Meetup at the GitHub HQ.
</p>

<p>
	GitHub is generously hosting us again at their headquarters, and it will be a great opportunity to meet
	community members and play Godot games.
</p>
