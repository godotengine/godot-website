<p>
	Behind the pompous name of <em>GodotCon</em> (short for Godot Convention), you will mostly find the first
	official IRL (*in real life*) meetup of the Godot community.
	We decided to organize such an event right after the FOSDEM so that people coming to Brussels for the former
	can also stay a bit longer for GodotCon.
</p>

<p>
	The entrance will of course be free, and the form that the event will take exactly will mostly depend upon
	the users and contributors who will be motivated in helping organizing it.
	The base plan is: we have a venue in Brussels, do Godot stuff there, and enjoy ourselves.
</p>

<h4>Schedule</h4>

<p>
	There is no precise plan as of yet, but various things have been mentioned during community discussions.
	Extending upon the above base plan, the idea is that some of us organize talks, crash courses, workshops, etc.
	for all to benefit from and learn together.
	The topics will include some advanced tips and tricks about using the engine, presentation and knowhow
	transfer from various published or WIP projects, etc.
	If there is interest, we also consider having hacking sessions regarding developing the engine or writing
	documentation, so that we can strengthen the community of co-developers.
</p>

<p>
	More details on all this in the coming weeks, but the TL;DR is: It will be cool and will be tailor-made for
	the attendants, so join us!
</p>
