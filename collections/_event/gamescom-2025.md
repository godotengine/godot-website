A small community meetup at gamescom to connect, share experiences, and discuss all things Godot. We do not have a booth, so we will meet somewhere near the IndieArenaBooth in hall 10. Details will be announced on the luma [event page](https://lu.ma/tpd4ks9a) once we know the exact place.

​​Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just exploring the engine, everyone is welcome!
