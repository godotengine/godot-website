<p>
	<a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> stands for Free and Open Source Developers' European Meeting and is
	held every year in February at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in Brussels, Belgium. It is arguably
	the biggest European event about free and open source software, with free entry and thousands of developers
	and users of various projects attending.
</p>

<p>
	We will have a Godot stand at the event, with many engine contributors and users available to discuss with
	visitors and showcase the engine. We'll also have Godot T-shirts to sell, and stickers and metal pins to
	give away.
</p>

<p>
	Some of us also organize the Game Development devroom, where talks will be given on Sat 1 February on various
	topics related to both game development and Free and Open Source Software. Some talks will be about Godot, but
	many others will cover different technology stacks and projects.
</p>

<p>
	Refer to the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020">FOSDEM 2020</a> website for more information on which projects
	will be there, as well as talks that you might be interested in. (Note: The final schedule for FOSDEM usually
	arrives quite late, so be patient. :))
