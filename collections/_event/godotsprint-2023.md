<p>
	For three days before <a href="#godotmeetup-2023">Godot User Meeting 2023</a>, we will be hosting what we call the
	Godot Sprint, an in person meeting for contributors to plan out the next year of development. This contributor
	sprint will be primarily intended for existing engine and documentation contributors, so that we can work on
	current topics together, review Pull Requests, discuss the roadmap, etc. We will also welcome users who aren't
	contributors yet but would like to get involved, be it with C++ engine contributions, documentation writing or
	the creation of other teaching materials (demos, courses, etc.).
</p>

<p>Entrance will be free.</p>
