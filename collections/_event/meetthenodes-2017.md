<p>
	We are organizing a Godot-focused event in Paris, France, on Saturday 22 April 2017. Many Godot developers
	and users will be there, including our lead dev Juan Linietsky (reduz). The event will take place at the
	Mozilla Space in Paris (address below), from 9 am up to approximately 7 pm (no big keynote should be after
	5 pm though).
</p>

<p>
	The event will be partly talks from Godot developers about their current projects, engine features, etc., as
	well as workshops. Both curious beginners and experienced developers should find something interesting to work
	on, be it discovering the engine and make a simple game or hacking at the engine code and developing new
	features.
</p>

<h4>Schedule and talks</h4>
<p>
	Call for papers coming soon™ on the blog. Expect at least talks or workshop led by key developers such as Juan
	Linietsky (reduz), Rémi Verschelde (Akien) and others.
</p>
