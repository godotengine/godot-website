    <strong>The Android editor is currently in an experimental stage. The UI has not been adapted for touch screens yet; using a hardware keyboard and mouse is strongly recommended.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Compared to using the editor on desktop platforms, the experience may be suboptimal, especially if you do not use a hardware keyboard and mouse. See the <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aplatform%3Aandroid+label%3Atopic%3Aeditor+">list of known issues affecting the Android editor</a> for more information.
