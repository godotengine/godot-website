title: Modify metadata without `rcedit`
blockquote: So long, `rcedit`!
text: |
  Windows ``.exe`` file metadata (such as a custom icon, the product name, and the company information) is stored internally as "resources".

  For years, in order to modify these resources, the Windows exporter needed to access an external Windows program: [``rcedit``](https://github.com/electron/rcedit). That made it really difficult to export for Windows on a non-Windows machine.

  But now, the Windows exporter knows how to handle the resources natively, so you can edit Windows export metadata without a hitch, on every platform.
