title: Allow selecting multiple remote nodes at runtime
text: |
  The new embedded game window [introduced in 4.4](/releases/4.4/#embedded-game-window) highlighted an issue the editor had for many years now: the remote node list didn’t support selecting more than one item.

  This is now a thing of the past. Developers can now select multiple nodes and even edit common properties.
