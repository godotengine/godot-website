title: Process navigation regions asynchronously
text: |
  The main thread of a computer program is like a project leader. If the project leader handles too many tasks and doesn’t delegate enough, it can affect the overall performance of the team.

  Enabling async iterations asks the navigation servers to delegate the navigation process to a background thread, which can improve overall navigation performance.
