text: |
  You can now export for Apple’s XR platform, visionOS, making Godot projects compatible with the Apple Vision Pro.

  Godot 4.5 marks the first step of visionOS’ native integration. For this, we would like to thank Apple’s visionOS engineering team for their contributions adding support for their operating system to the Godot Engine.

  This is a big deal: visionOS is the first platform supported natively by Godot since the project was open-sourced!

  Currently, it is only possible to export a project as a "windowed app". Your game will appear as a window, floating in the user’s 3D space. We expect to support fully immersive experiences in the future.
