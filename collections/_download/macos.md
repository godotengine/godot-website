  <ul>
    <li>Extract and run. Godot is self-contained and does not require installation.</li>
    <li>If you run into an issue, check the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a> page for common issues and their solutions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Godot is code-signed and notarized for macOS. This means it should run out of the box even if Gatekeeper is enabled on the system (which is the default).
  </p>

  <p>
    For older Godot versions, see the last section of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">this page</a> for instructions on allowing Godot to run anyway. Alternatively, you can install <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/404790">Godot from Steam</a> and switch to an older branch in the Steam application settings to work around this.
