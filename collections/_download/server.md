#### Instructions


- Extract and run. Godot is self-contained and does not require installation.
- If you run into an issue, check the [Troubleshooting](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/troubleshooting.html) page for common issues and their solutions.

- The _headless_ build includes the editor tool functionality that enables it to run tests and export projects in an automated manner.
- The _server_ build is optimized to run dedicated game servers and does not include editor tools, graphics or audio support.
