#### Instructions

- If you run into an issue, check the [Troubleshooting](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/troubleshooting.html) page for common issues and their solutions.


To install the APK file, allow your current browser to install APKs from unknown sources in your device's settings.


**The Android editor is currently in an experimental stage. The UI has not been adapted for touch screens yet; using a hardware keyboard and mouse is strongly recommended.**

Compared to using the editor on desktop platforms, the experience may be frustrating, especially if you do not use a hardware keyboard and mouse. See the [list of known issues affecting the Android editor](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aplatform%3Aandroid+label%3Atopic%3Aeditor+) for more information.
