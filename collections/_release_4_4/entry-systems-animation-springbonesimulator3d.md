  The [VRMSpringBone](https://vrm.dev/en/univrm/springbone/univrm_secondary/) has been available as an add-on on the asset library for a while now, but there were some issues that could only be fixed by a more direct implementation.

  The animation team refined the MIT-distributed code based on Godot's <span class="code-highlight basetype">SkeletonModifier3D</span> node, and tied it in with existing core functionality. This helps improve both usability and performance.
