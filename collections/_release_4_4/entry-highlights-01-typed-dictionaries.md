  Godot 4.0 introduced supported for typed arrays, but lacked support for typed dictionaries. This rapidly became one of the most requested features to add to the engine, and thanks to Thaddeus Crews, it is now implemented for Godot 4.4! This feature impacts the core engine, GDScript, and all other scripting languages when interfacing with Godotâ€™s Dictionary type. You can now export typed dictionaries from scripts and benefit from a much improved Inspector UX to assign the right keys and values.

  As a related improvement, support for StringName dictionary keys has also been optimized by Rune (GH-70096).
