  Thanks to Godot’s unique feature of having an editor made with the engine itself, we’ve been able to bring the Godot editor to unconventional places, such as the web and Android devices. Building upon the latter, Fredia Huya-Kouadio completed the proof of concept started by Bastiaan Olij years ago, to add support for using the Android editor in an XR context using OpenXR (GH-96624)! You can test the current version by sideloading the APK, currently supported on Meta Quest 3 or Quest Pro.
