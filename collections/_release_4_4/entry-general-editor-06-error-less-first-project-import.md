  No one wants to be met with a wall of errors after freshly importing their project from a version control system.

  This used to happen because it is not necessary to push the .godot folder into your repositories, since it auto-generates upon opening your project for the first time. After that, you had to restart the editor to get rid of all the errors caused by broken references — not anymore!
