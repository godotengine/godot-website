  Markers allow you to create subregions of an animation that can be jumped to or looped without playing the entire animation.

  These markers are also supported inside the Animation Tree, where you can easily create an <span class="code-highlight basetype">AnimationNode</span>â€™s custom timeline based on the markers.
