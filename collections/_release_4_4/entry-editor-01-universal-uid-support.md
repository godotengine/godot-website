  Partial Unique Identifier (UID) support – a way to reference resources without relying on human-readable file paths prone to change – has been present in the engine since Godot 4.0, but many file types did not benefit from it yet. Now this fully supported workflow makes Godot more resistant to changes in your filesystem organization, and therefore more suitable to larger projects.
