  With the release of Godot 4.0, we moved our C# packages from targeting Mono to .NET 6. This version of .NET was released on November 8, 2021 and ended support on November 12, 2024.

  Therefore, our next release will implement and raise the minimum required version to .NET 8; existing projects will automatically be upgraded when opened with Godot 4.4 while older releases will keep targeting .NET 6 to avoid breakage.
