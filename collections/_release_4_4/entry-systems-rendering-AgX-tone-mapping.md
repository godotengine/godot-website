  This tone mapping algorithm has gained a lot of popularity lately. Our friends at Blender even replaced their previous "filmic" tone mapper with AgX.

  The Godot implementation resembles theirs closely, but is purposely of lower quality to be more suitable for real time use cases.

  AgX is a stylized tone mapper that gives a movie-esque quality to renders, and is capapble of handling very bright scenes better than our other available options.
