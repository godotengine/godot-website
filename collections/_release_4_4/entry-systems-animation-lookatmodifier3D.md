  This new node type is used to handle 3D model procedural animation, partially replacing the deprecated <span class="code-highlight basetype">SkeletonIK3D</span>. It is specialized to make a character model look in the target direction.

  Therefore users can now assign angle limitations, forward axis settings, and more directly instead of relying on specific bone structures or arbitrary layouts.
