  Typed dictionaries are coming to the Godot. This impacts the core engine, GDScript, and all other scripting languages when interfacing with Godot's <span class="code-highlight basetype">Dictionary</span> type.

  The Inspector UX has been improved accordingly, to let you assign the right keys and values directly in the editor.

image_alt: "A simple GDScript file showing two typed dictionary declarations: one valid export, and another simple variable declaration that isn't correctly initialized. The parser detects that the dictionary expects `StringName` as keys and `float` as values, but a string was supplied as a value instead."
