blockquote: <span class="highlight">Debugging</span> in style
text: |
  Collision shapes now have <span class="code-highlight membervariable">debug_color</span> and <span class="code-highlight membervariable">debug_fill</span> properties for you to customize in the editor. If "Visible Collision Shapes" is enabled in the debug menu, you can even change these at runtime.
