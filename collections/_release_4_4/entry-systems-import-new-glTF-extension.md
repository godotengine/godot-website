title: New glTF extension
blockquote: <span class="highlight">Customizable</span> animation imports
text: |
  Previously, glTF imports only allowed you to target properties from this list: position, rotation, scale, and mesh blend shape weights.

  This new extension now enables animations to animate custom properties too! Think the color of a light, the FOV of a camera, the albedo color of a material, the UV offset of a material, â€¦

  The mappings between Godot properties and [glTF Object Model](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/specification/2.0/ObjectModel.adoc) JSON pointers can be defined via GDScript.
