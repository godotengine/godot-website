blockquote: A <span class="highlight">performance</span> boost for everyone
text: |
  The changes made to how SceneTree system works, specifically how it processes changes to the nodes, result in an editor performance increase for all projects.

  Moving or renaming nodes in complex scenes will be a much faster experience now!
