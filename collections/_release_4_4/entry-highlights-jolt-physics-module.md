  This module has been the _de facto_ physics engine for many Godot developers since its inception in late 2022, so it only made sense to promote it to an official addon for more users to find.

  Now the Godot Jolt maintainers have taken it one step further: integrating the module into the engine directly. A process that ended up requiring over 500 files and 115 thousand lines of code!

  While this PR might be one of the most rigorously tested ones, we are eagerly awaiting your feedback (and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues)) to eventually be able to drop the "experimental" label on this addition. Until then, you have to enable this alternative to Godot Physics in the project settings. Before you do, make sure to check if your interests/use-cases are properly supported in the documentation.
