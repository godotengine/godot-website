  The [Betsy texture compressor](https://github.com/darksylinc/betsy) is a tool to compress images into various GPU texture formats. It is now being integrated into the Godot Engine.

  Betsy runs on the GPU and is able to compress images significantly faster than our current compressors (using the “VRAM Compressed” import setting).

  This change reduces import time dramatically.
