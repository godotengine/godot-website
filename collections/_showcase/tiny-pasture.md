description: "Meet your new little desk buddies! They’ll snooze, scratch, and scamper around while you work or study (don’t worry, they’ve been trained not to invade your workspace). If you’re good at animal management, they will occupy the bottom of your screen with different kinds and colors!"

Tiny Pasture is your charming little farm simulator that cozies up at the bottom of your screen, keeping you company while you work or study. In this game, you can buy adorable baby animals, grow them, and collect coins dropped from them once they’re all grown up to rake in some sweet profits and expand your pasture. When you improve yourself and have fun, your little critters will grow with you.

### Unlock New Species
Rabbits, foxes, alpacas, birds... and even slimes and zombies? Before long, you'll have an entire animal army!

### Get Interactive with Your Animals
Feed them, click on them, and watch them grow happily! You can also click on them with the middle mouse button to make them follow your cursor around!

### Raise a New Life
Place the Mystery Curtain in the Pasture and choose two adult animals of the same species. After a while, they'll breed and bring forth newborn animals!

### Magic Pasture
Purchase and deploy magical facilities to help you keep your animals clean and healthy!

### Other features
Freely drag and adjust the length of the pasture. Place it anywhere on your screen!
