Time is running out and the reactor is on the brink of meltdown. Explore the facility and manipulate the many electrical hazards and locked doors to find a way deeper, towards the source of the problem. Your only tool: a mechanical grabber-arm allowing you to lift and move boxes from afar.

Think hard, because the reactor core could go into meltdown at any moment.

- A short and adorable new adventure from the team behind A Monster’s Expedition and A Good Snowman is Hard to Build.
- Elegant puzzle design with escalating complexity.
- 30-90 minutes play time, ideal for a single play session.
