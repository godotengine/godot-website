_"The world hasn't ended yet."_


Mark, an average irresponsible high school student, tries to get by and find purpose in a humdrum life of scrolling, cramming, and traffic. He meets friends, both old and new, and embarks upon a seemingly never-ending trouble, until nothing is ever the same again.

Until Then is a contemporary story game inspired by the Philippines, its lifestyle, and culture. Featuring a smartphone where mechanics of modern living come into play, chat with your classmates, browse the web, and explore the depths of social networks.
