  title: "Why the developer chose Godot"
  context: "â€” Godot Showcase - Material Maker"
  url: "/article/godot-showcase-material-maker"
  text: "<p>
  It is really funny that I discovered Godot just like Material Maker gained its current visibility. I discovered this game engine while watching a video from GameFromScratch covering Godot around the time it went open source.
</p>
<p>
  I tried it for a few very small game prototypes (including one featuring a silly mouse for my very first game jam) and I must admit it immediately clicked for me. Godot was far from what it would become, but I already loved the nodes approach and how natural the overall design felt.
</p>
<p>
  I've been using Godot for all my game development projects and prototypes ever since, and it consistently proves easy and efficient to work with.

<p>
  Material Maker is a procedural materials authoring tool, based on the Godot
  Engine. Materials are defined as graphs where nodes create or transform
  textures, and can be exported for the Godot, Unity, and Unreal game engines.
</p>
<p>
  A base library of over 200 nodes that define shapes, patterns, filters and
  transforms on textures, as well as 2D and 3D shapes described as signed
  distance functions.
</p>
<p>
  New group nodes and shader nodes can easily be created using the user interface.
  Use the vast library of hundreds of materials, nodes, brushes, and environments
  made by our community, for use in your projects or for studying how nodes work.
