<p>
  Material Maker is a procedural materials authoring tool, based on the Godot
  Engine. Materials are defined as graphs where nodes create or transform
  textures, and can be exported for the Godot, Unity and Unreal game engines.
</p>
<p>
  A base library of ~150 nodes that define shapes, patterns, filters and
  transforms on textures, as well as 2D and 3D shapes described as signed
  distance functions.
</p>

  New group nodes and shader nodes can easily be created using the user interface.
