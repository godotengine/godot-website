Darkness, despair, challenge... The world as we know it is run over by eldritch monstrosities. Survivors are few and far between, stuck between living in this new, grim world and scheming to overthrow others. You have been chosen to bear the greatest burden - the Herald’s Blade. Are you going to help your covenant or take over as the new overlord? Do you really have a choice?

Experience a unique ACTION STEALTH game created specifically for mobile. A hand crafted, pixel art world full of horrific creatures and hidden tragedies. Play with ONE hand and defeat enemies by using slick COMBOS and special ITEMS, while dashing through the environment with blinding speed! Discover a clandestine plot in this ruined world, where friends will betray you and foes will aid you...

Master the blade, master your surroundings and CONQUER!

But remember...

**YOU ARE ALONE. YOU WILL DIE. YOU WILL DO IT AGAIN.**

After two possible endings, see how far you can get in an ENDLESS MODE where you explore and conquer procedurally generated levels.

Fight against over 15 UNIQUE enemy types, Elite enemies and 4 carefully crafted BOSSES that will test your skills to their limit.

Speak to many colorful characters and try to piece together the bigger picture.

Uncover your own origin as your perspective on evil changes with every nightmare and flashback.

**ORIGINAL CONTROLS** - Built natively for touchscreen and one handed play, movement and combat interact smoothly and seamlessly.

**TENSE, UNNERVING AND MYSTERIOUS** - Reap through the ruined world with fast and furious dashes off walls, while staying out of sight of monstrosities, away from traps and countless hazards!

**HARDCORE DIFFICULTY** - Combine speed, skill, wits & reflexes, to solve increasingly complex rooms, use powerful items, and CONQUER gigantic bosses!

**HANDCRAFTED & UNIQUE ARTSTYLE** - A depressing, unique, visual horror where every nook and cranny was crafted to keep you on your toes and intensify the experience.


A GRIM quest awaits you! Will you answer the Heralds’ call?
