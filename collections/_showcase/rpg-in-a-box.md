  text: "<p>
  One of the primary aspects that drew me to try Godot was its built-in UI components,
  since it would allow me to easily build the various editors and interfaces
  that I needed while also supporting graphical elements like 3D viewports.
  The fact that it's open source and supports multiple platforms,
  as well as how lightweight the engine is, are all attractive aspects that made
  the choice even more straightforward.

  RPG in a Box lets you easily create 3D grid-based, voxel-style RPGs and
  adventure games! As its name suggests, it will contain every tool necessary
  for turning your ideas into games, all packaged together "in a box". The
  software is designed with a beginner-friendly approach as to not require any
  programming or modelling knowledge while still providing a wide range of
  customization and openness.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Voxel Editor: Build tiles, objects, and characters from 3D pixel blocks
    (i.e. voxels) and easily animate them with the editor's
    frame-based/stop-motion animation system. Importing from MagicaVoxel (.vox)
    is also supported.
  </li>
  <li>
    Map Editor: Create grid-based worlds with the tiles you've built, then bring
    them to life by adding interactive NPCs and objects using the editor's
    intuitive navigation and interaction system.
  </li>
  <li>
    Scripting: Set up and trigger in-game events with the visual, node-based
    script editor. Simply drag and drop the desired actions (no programming
    knowledge required), or manually code "quick scripts" using Bauxite, the
    engine's custom scripting language.
  </li>
  <li>
    Basic dialogue and item systems, multiple camera options, UI customization,
    sound effect generator, and much more!
  </li>
</ul>
