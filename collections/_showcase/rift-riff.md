_Jump a rift, fight off monsters, and plunder their world._ Rift Riff is a tower defense game noteworthy in two ways: it's particularly strategic and remarkably forgiving.

### Strategic
At the heart of the strategic layer of Rift Riff is a mix of choosing what towers you bring into each rift and being clever about the various monster behaviors. Monsters attack in waves, either going straight for your Extractor (your main tower) or attacking every tower in proximity. To defend yourself, you choose a handful of towers at the start of a scenario and build them on predetermined spots on the map. You obtain juice (your build resource) during monster waves and have the ability to build and upgrade towers before and during each wave. Surviving the onslaught of monsters gives you prisms, which in turn unlocks more rifts, towers, companions, and tower upgrades.

### Forgiving
Don’t have enough juice to build your tower? Schedule it. Built the wrong tower? Get a full refund. Lost a tower? It’ll respawn for free after the wave. Lost your Extractor? Only redo the last wave. Having a hard time? Pick flowers for a bit of extra juice.

### Content
The full game currently features ± 15–20 hours of gameplay:

- 20 worlds with 2 or more scenarios each.
- 17 tower types with 7 overpowered upgrades.
- 25 monster types with varying behaviors.
- 6 companions who'll assist you and your towers.
- 45 challenges for die hards.
- All the good Steam stuff: achievements, stats, controller support, cloud saves, etc.

### Made by…
Rift Riff is made by game designer Adriaan de Jongh (best known for the indie hit Hidden Folks), graphic designer Sim Kaart, enemy wave designer Professional Panda, music composer and sound designer Matthijs Koster, and programmer Franz LaZerte.
