Take charge of the Spooky Express; the only rail service willing to carry the undead passengers of deepest, darkest Trainsylvania. In your new role you'll plan routes and lay train tracks to meet your creepy commuters' demands, and create a rail network spanning more than 200 thoughtfully designed levels.

Each monster has a home of their own: take the vampires to their coffins and the zombies to their graves, and escort the interloping humans away before they’re snacked upon. There’s only room for one at a time in the passenger car and the track can’t cross itself, so plot your route carefully, lay the tracks, and don't let the train miss its stops.

Trainsylvania spans a host of unique locations, with each puzzle forming a cosy diorama, complete with spooky soundtrack. Whether you're puzzling through the Pumpkin Patch, meandering through the Morbid Manor, or investigating the Impish Inferno, you'll find playful touches and surprises around every corner.

- 🦇 An elegant, playful puzzler, jam-packed with monsters and mechanics.
- 🚂 Thoughtfully designed puzzles which expertly balance complexity and approachability.
- 🎃 Created by the award-winning designers of A Monster's Expedition, A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build, Cosmic Express and more.
- 🎨 Featuring several delightful comics from David Hellman and Zac Gorman.
- 🎵 Accompanied by a haunting soundtrack from Priscilla Snow.
