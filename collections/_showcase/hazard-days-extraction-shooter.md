### ☢️ Core Gameplay ☢️
#### 1. Loot and Equip
The post apocalypse world is scarred by war, radiation, and biological disasters. Your everyday routine becomes pure pixel survival against mutants and radiation. Every item—from a pixel gun to radiation meds—could mean a difference between life and sustained combat. Manage your inventory wisely; greed weighs you down, but empty hands won’t survive the outbreak.

#### 2. Dark Survival and Craft
The world days after the disaster feels empty and hostile. Some of your raids take place in zombie apocalypse zones cut off by radiation. Use pixel shooter mechanics to aim, duck, blast your way through the apocalyptic survival games. But ammo is scarce—sometimes, R day survival means stealth or fleeing.

#### 3. Escape and Progress
Zombie apocalypse areas hide rare resources but are crawling with mutants and toxic storms. Complete extraction missions to unlock new zones.

Develop your character and fight with a tribe diplomat, wolf, nuclear day zombies.
