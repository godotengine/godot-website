  text: "<p>
  I felt like Godot enabled me to pull the core game together very quickly. The
  most attractive parts of the engine for me come from its nature as a Free/Open
  Source Software project and the ability that gives me to debug, fix, or
  modify the engine to suit my personal needs.
</p>
<p>
  I also feel more comfortable using free and Free tools because I can be
  confident that if others want to follow in my footsteps, financial or
  philosophical hurdles won't prevent them from doing so.

  Build a hive, make some honey! Hive Time is a small, bee themed
  management/base building sim. Harvest resources, grow your hive, and produce a
  new Queen before the current one dies. Manage different bee roles in a totally
  scientifically inaccurate depiction of hive dynamics. Send Foragers out to
  find pollen and nectar, have Builders research new cell types, and ensure you
  have enough Beesitters to raise the next generation of bees. Make interesting
  choices that affect the hive - respond to wasp attacks, deal with outlaw
  slugs, or help a caterpillar realise a lifelong dream.
