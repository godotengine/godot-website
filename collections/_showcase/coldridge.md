**Coldridge is a push-your-luck board game: Explore and Exploit, with gambling and roguelike mechanics.**

### THE GOLD RUSH: HIGH RISK, HIGH REWARD
Pick contracts, go out and prospect for rare resources. The riskier the contract, the juicier the reward but the harder the fall.

With no scores, no time limits, and no game-overs, Tiny Garden is all about relaxation and creativity. The more you explore, the more you’ll discover.

### BREAK THE GAME
Find the best synergies with over 50+ items and 4 characters to play. There's always a new build available to beat your high score

### BOARD GAME MECHANICS AND MOVEMENT PLANNING
Fulfill your contracts by meticulously planning your moves. Utilize the terrain and your equipment to gain an edge, outmaneuver obstacles, and complete your objectives efficiently.

### INSPIRATIONS

Coldridge takes inspiration from games like Catan, Dorfromantik, Carcassonne, Wingspan, or Ticket To Ride. We're huge board game fans, but also Rogue-lite and Soulslike games fans
