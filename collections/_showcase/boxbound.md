The world is changing, but you still have to go to work.

Step into the satirical world of Boxbound, a story-driven endless puzzle game that blends simplistic puzzle gameplay with a captivating narrative.

You work in the warehouse alongside your stressed and overworked co-worker, Peter. Together, you tackle the endless stream of packages, solving day-to-day complications in the workplace while massive events unfold outside. Political upheaval, economic shifts, and a charismatic new leader changing the world — but within the warehouse, the grind never stops.

It's not just a puzzle game - you’re diving into an ever-evolving experience. The game offers 9223372036854775807 levels, ensuring endless gameplay that will keep your brain fit for a lifetime (or around four billion lifetimes, to be precise, if you spend one second on each level).

But it’s not just about sorting packages. Unexpected challenges and mini-games regularly disrupt your routine, forcing you to adapt and think creatively. Sweep up trash, work in the dark during power outages, or even drive the delivery truck from time to time. The surprises never stop, just like the work.

Features:

- Endless Puzzle Gameplay: Dive into an infinite supply of challenging levels designed to test your organizational skills and creativity.
- Dynamic Events: Encounter unpredictable scenarios that keep gameplay fresh and exciting.
- Compelling Storytelling: Experience a twisting, satirical tale of ordinary work-life amidst extraordinary world events.
