  I think without Godot I'd be much farther behind where I am now. Godot just works in a way that meshes with how I like to think and work. I'd be much less productive for sure.

  The 2D workflow is pretty great. Just drop some images in and drag them onto
  the canvas, attach a script, write a few lines of GDScript and you've got the
  beginning of a game. Modifying assets is seamless. And the node tree is super
  powerful. Reusing scenes in other scenes allows me to do a lot of stuff
  quickly and visually that would have been much more cumbersome in other
  frameworks.

<p>
  Gravity Ace is a 2D multi-directional gravity shooter (cave-flyer). It's a
  love letter to Thrust and Gravitar and all of the amazing games they inspired.
  Descend into dark caverns, fly and blast your way past enemies, retrieve the
  reactor core and make your escape, all while fighting the deadly embrace of
  crushing gravity.
