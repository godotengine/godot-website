Sharpen your critical thinking skills in this quiz game that challenges you to spot rhetorical fallacies.

### Spot The Fallacies!
You know how sometimes people try to persuade you by using misleading or incorrect reasoning? That's what we call fallacies. By mastering Fallacy Quiz you might get better at spotting them.

### Everyone likes this game, so you must too, **right?**
Being more adept at identifying deceptive arguments helps you recognize when someone is trying to manipulate you. This skill is key to prevent yourself from being misled or swayed in everyday situations!

### How High Will You Score?
In the game, you'll be presented with various statements and asked to determine if they are valid or invalid. In harder levels, you will need to identify the specific fallacy that is being employed. The faster and more accurately you identify each fallacy, the higher your score!

You can even play the game locally with your friends thanks to a local multiplayer mode, you can play with a friend using only one keyboard, or you can plug controllers to have up to four players!

### Sharpen Your Critical Thinking Skills
As your skills improve, so too will your ability to discern between logical and illogical arguments in real-life situations! You also have access to an in-game glossary of close to fifty fallacies. Be better equipped to avoid being manipulated by flawed reasoning. Put on your thinking cap, and get ready to challenge your mind in Fallacy Quiz!
