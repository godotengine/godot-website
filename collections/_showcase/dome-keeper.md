  Defend your dome from wave after wave of monsters in this innovative roguelike survival miner, Dome Keeper. Use the time between each attack to dig beneath the surface in search of valuable resources and artifacts – use them carefully to choose powerful upgrades and bonuses. Set on beautifully crafted pixel art alien planets, Dome Keeper offers a captivating atmosphere with music tracks fusing melodic and synthetic creations.
</p>
<h3>Dig</h3>
<p>
	Drill tunnels beneath your dome in search of precious materials or to uncover powerful hidden artifacts. Watch the time, you need to get back to the dome and be ready when the next wave of attack comes. How deep will you get this time? How much can you carry back?
</p>
<h3>Defend</h3>
<p>
	Take control of your defenses to fend off the alien attacks. Air and ground, slow and fast; the attackers must be prioritized and dealt with before they tear your dome apart.
</p>
<h3>Develop</h3>
<p>
	Utilize your mineral harvest to unlock powerful upgrades: augment your weapons, enhance the impact of your drill, boost your jetpack’s max speed, and many other upgrade paths -- each of which gives you and your dome the best odds for survival!
