## Mine resources! Upgrade your gear! Make Profit!

It is a dangerous but lucrative job. Explore this vast procedurally generated world with your jetpack. Extract the minerals with an explosive gel. Expand your mining platform. But most importantly: stay alive.

## The game offers you:
- Mining and selling resources for profit
- Exploring an infinite procedurally generated world
- Upgrading your gear
- A lot of explosions

The depths of the planet hide many unique biomes and treasures, but also dangers. Every biome has its own way to harm you and having the right set of gear will make your life much easier.

On the ground, you can build your base of operation. Different machines allow you to process and trade the resources that you have brought from your last mining operation.
