description: "Paragraphic is created by the developer of Vectoraster and Patternodes, two macOS-exclusive design tools for creating custom vector halftones, patterns and animations. With Paragraphic the idea is to combine and develop the ideas and features behind these established tools even further in a new more accessible UI, and to make this available cross platform on macOS, Window and Linux."

### Complex repetitions, gradients and patterns
Create and modify multi-level repetitions and patterns, applying flexible modifiers or randomization using a modular procedural design system.

Then just copy and paste the result as SVG vectors into your workflow.

### Non-destructive randomization
Replace, reorder or transform repeated elements at random with full control to add interest to your design.

All non-destructive with updates in real time to encourage gradual testing and tweaking.

### Custom vector halftones
Create halftones, raster patterns and advanced vector gradients based on images or any other layer data.

### Parametric design
Automate design tasks, link properties and create data visualizations using custom parameters and connections to control your designs.

### Core features
- **Modular design system**, using a sequence of nodes on each layer that can be freely combined to create, repeat and modify content elements on each layer.
- **Non-destructive editing with real-time feedback**, any property of any step in the generation sequence can easily be edited with the end result updated live.
- **Parametric control and connections**, for precise values, automatic relationships between properties and data-driven designs.
- **Familiar layer-based editor**, wrapping the parametric generative node sequence features in a traditional graphical editor interface similar to other vector graphics editors.
- **SVG import and export**, designed to work as a complement to your existing design tools, just copy & paste between them as SVG.
