Usagi Shima『うさぎしま』is a relaxing, idle bunny collecting game developed by solo developer pank0 (aka Jess Yu).

You’ve been tasked as caretaker of an abandoned island — as you decorate it over time, curious (but adorable!) bunny visitors start to appear! Buy toys, plants, and build structures on an abandoned island to entice curious bun tourists to pay your island a visit.

Discover, take photos, and make friends with a variety of bunnies that visit based on how you’ve decorated and arranged the island.
