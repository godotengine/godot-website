Step into the furry paws of Bearnard, a brave bear on a mission to reclaim the legendary bow and defend his treasured woodland from looming threats. As you embark on this single-player adventure, journey through varied landscapes, confront countless enemies, and solve physics-driven puzzles. Unleash the power of different cards in turn-based battles, strategizing your every move to outwit and overcome hostile creatures.

**Explore, find secrets, collect artifacts, improve your archery skills and be smart while using cards in hand.**

### Master the card play and define your strategy
Discover a vast collection of cards and use their special abilities to complete your journey. From healing to defense, and even crowd-control of foes, every card can be a game-changer.

Wander through levels, defeat enemies, and uncover special chests to expand your deck with common, rare, epic, and legendary cards. Combine elemental cards to create powerful combos. In combat, play your cards wisely to outmaneuver and overpower your foes.

### Experience a dynamic platforming adventure
Journey across diverse terrains as Bearnard! Travel through forests, delve into mines, climb snowy mountains, enter vast castles, and explore dark dungeons.

Each biome is filled with its own challenges and lurking evil. Face dangerous obstacles and enemies in real-time platforming action, as you navigate through handcrafted levels that capture the essence of Bearnard's adventurous world.

### Unravel the secrets of the environment
As you journey through Bearnard's realm, you'll encounter varied puzzles that demand both skill and intelligence. Shoot an arrow at a lever to open locked passages, or use your bow to trigger platforms that catapult Bearnard to new heights.

### Harness the power of physics to defeat your enemies
In Bearnard's world, surroundings are more than just scenery — they can be your most powerful weapon. Use physics to crash chandeliers onto foes and throw crates for crushing blows. Be creative and transform ordinary objects into deadly tools of destruction!

### Put your platforming skills to the test
Enter bonus levels where skills and your strategy are put to the test. These challenges, varying in nature, will require precision, creativity, and quick thinking. Complete them to earn prestigious medals – gold, silver, or bronze. While these tokens of achievement don't directly affect gameplay, they stand as a proud testament to your mastery and accomplishments.

### But wait, there is more!
Get ready for spontaneous bursts of humor, thanks to Bearnard's sharp wit. And let's not forget his trusty sidekick, Blue - the vibrant owl always ready to swoop in and lend a wing to fetch the unreachable, or deliver essential cards. Now, just when you think you've seen it all, watch out for the most heartwarming bear ear wiggle animation in gaming. Dive in, laugh out loud, and let the charm of Bearnard's adventure captivate you!
