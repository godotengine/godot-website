Blender Studio's official game project is a short casual interactive story.
Play a big, adorable dog traversing through winter woods and help a little kid decorate a snowman with colorful items hidden in the environment.

## Explore

You are let loose to roam camping grounds, forest paths, idyllic creeks and a frozen pond in this miniature open world.

## Bound together

Guide or drag around your little kid owner that you have in tow. Help each other out, be a menace or be a good boy.

## Play your way

Dive straight in and have the game react to your play-style and choices.
There are no fail states, only player-driven moments.

## A paper craft world

Traverse an environment made of real-life paper-crafted models, scanned and recreated to be played with.

## Free for everyone

Brought to you by the Blender Studio as the new free and creative commons "Open Project".
Made with, and available as free and open-source software.

The project was used to test and improve both Blender and the Godot Game Engine.
