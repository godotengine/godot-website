Gourdlets is a city-building sandbox. Place buildings and scenery, and then watch visiting gourdlets arrive and interact with the world. No objectives, no points, just building.

Place buildings, decorations, and crops to build your town!

Watch the population of gourdlets grow and interact with the town as you create it!

Relax and watch the little gourdlets live their little lives!
