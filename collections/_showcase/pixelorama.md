  Pixelorama is a free & open source pixel art sprite editor, with animation
  support. It is made entirely with the Godot&nbsp;Engine. Current features as of
  version v0.9:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>16 different tools to help you draw, which you can map to both of your left and right mouse buttons.</li>
  <li>Are you an animator? Pixelorama has its own animation timeline just for you! You can work at an individual cel level, where each cel refers to a unique layer and frame. Supports onion skinning, cel linking, motion drawing and frame grouping with tags.</li>
