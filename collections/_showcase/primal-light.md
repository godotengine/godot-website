  context: "— Godot Showcase - Primal Light developer interview"
  url: "/article/godot-showcase-fat-gem-primal-light"
  text: "<p>
  Godot has a ton of strengths. A few come to mind. First, Godot uses the pixel
  as the native unit of measurement, which makes it ideal for 2D games. Second,
  Godot has a much better implementation of coroutines than other engines (and
  coroutines are a game developer’s best friend). Third, Godot’s signal system
  provides an out-of-the-box implementation of the observer pattern that is more
  intuitive that what you have in other engines (for example, using C# events).
  Finally, Godot has better animation tools than other engines I have worked
  with.
