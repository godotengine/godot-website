A first-person action game that provides various ways for defeating your foes, with weaponry, magic, stealth, or clever tactics like kicking them into deadly spikes.

### Fight In Brutal Combats
Fight enemies using melee and range weapons. Hack, slash, bash, stab you enemies. Block their attacks or roll away to dodge. Throw your weapon at them. Disarm them. Grapple them. Throw Them. Kick them into anything or kick anything into them.

### Unleash the Elements
Use a variety of spells such as incineration, freezing, electrocution, illusion or telekinesis. Strategically deploy spells as traps on the ground, or infuse your weapons with these powers. If it's not enough, just mind-control your foes.

### Hide in the shadows
Sneak through guard patrols and backstab them, pickpocket their weapons, hide in barrels, or distract them.

### Use the Environment
Make good use of the conveniently placed environmental hazard. Kick enemies in spikes, in water, in fire, in chasms. Throw crates at them. Throw tables, red barrels™, other dead enemies, other alive enemies. Kick them in stairs to knock them down. Use torches/lamps to put them on fire. Everything can be a weapon.
