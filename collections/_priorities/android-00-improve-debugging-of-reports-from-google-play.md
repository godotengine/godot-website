description: |
  When your game launches on Google Play, you will start to get automated reports from players highlighting issues like freezes, crashes, or poor performance. Right now that information is hard to make sense of due to the lack of debug symbols. We want to make it easier for users to utilize these reports either by providing debug symbols, or streamlining the process for developers to upload debug symbols themselves.
