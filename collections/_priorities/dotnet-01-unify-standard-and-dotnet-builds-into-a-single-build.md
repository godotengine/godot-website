  For the time being, users are required to download an entirely separate Godot build in order to use C# features. With our new upcoming .NET module, we intend to support C# with a simple plugin.

  Everyone wins, as users won’t have to choose a special version to run C#. It reduces the number of builds on our side by half. Also, it will simplify .NET maintenance.
