title: "Improve import dialog to provide more control over imported resources"
description: |
  Godot currently has an advanced import dialog which allows you to tweak many properties while importing assets. We want to polish and expand this dialog to be more powerful. At the very least we would like to improve the preview lighting, expose more tools for material editing, and expose many more common properties.
